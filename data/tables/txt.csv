Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments."

Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate."

Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. While Cameco does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2023 and 2022, its equity-investee Westinghouse does.

Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period.

Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the average monthly exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non- monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the average monthly exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at the average monthly exchange rate at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize."

Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized using the units of production method over their estimated remaining useful lives.

Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in joint ventures and an associate. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Company has joint control, whereby it has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in the joint ventures and associate are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and OCI and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the joint ventures and associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized."

Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term."

Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity)."

Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. The Companys financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. The Companys financial assets measured at FVTPL include foreign currency contracts. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. The Companys financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease obligations and long- term debt. The Companys financial liabilities measured at FVTPL include foreign currency contracts and interest rate contracts. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss."

Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products, except in limited circumstances. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered."

For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution.

Changes in accounting policy A number of amendments to existing standards became effective January 1, 2023 but they did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. i. Income taxes In May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued International Tax Reform  Pillar Two Model Rules, which amended IAS 12, Income Taxes (IAS 12). The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendments apply to income taxes arising from changes to tax law enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Cameco applied the temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax related to Pillar Two income taxes. We have not included additional disclosures arising from this amendment in these consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 because the impact was not material. ii. Disclosure of accounting policies In February 2021, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies (IAS 1). The amendment was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and provided requirements and guidance to help entities make more effective accounting policy disclosures. We have reviewed our disclosures in note 2 and amended them to only include accounting policy information that we considered material based on the new guidance. B. New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of amendments to existing standards are not yet effective for the year ended December 31, 2023 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Cameco does not intend to early adopt any of the amendments and does not expect them to have a material impact on its financial statements."

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Further details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets and investments Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments in associates and joint ventures when there is an indication of possible impairment. If it is determined that carrying values of assets cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements, mineral reserves and the impact of geopolitical events. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generating units In performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the end of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs, timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. Income taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In calculating income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on assumptions and judgments regarding future market conditions and production rates, which can materially impact estimated future taxable income. If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earnings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates of life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amounts of depreciation charged to earnings."

Acquisitions A. Westinghouse Electric Company (Westinghouse) On November 7, 2023, Cameco acquired a 49 % interest in Westinghouse, one of the worlds largest nuclear services businesses, in partnership with Brookfield Asset Management alongside its publicly listed affiliate Brookfield Renewable Partners (Brookfield) and its institutional partners. Brookfield, with its institutional partners, owns the other 51 %. The acquisition represents an investment in additional nuclear fuel cycle assets that the Company expects will augment the core of its business. To finance its 49 % share of the purchase price, $ 2,140,305,000 (US), Cameco used a combination of cash, debt and equity. The Company used $ 1,540,305,000 (US) of cash and $ 600,000,000 (US) in term loans (see note 14). In 2022, Cameco had issued 34,057,250 common shares pursuant to a public offering to help fund the acquisition (see note 17). At December 31, 2023, $ 50,000,000 (US) remained in escrow, to be paid upon finalization of the closing statement. The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The values assigned to Camecos share of the net assets acquired were as follows: Net assets acquired (USD) Cash and cash equivalents $ 254,800 Other current assets 938,413 Property, plant and equipment 787,278 Intangible assets 2,852,780 Goodwill 568,631 Non-current assets 346,891 Current liabilities (1,164,621) Non-current liabilities (2,443,867) Total $ 2,140,305 Cash 1,540,305 Term loans [note 14] 600,000 Total $ 2,140,305 Fair values were determined using a number of different valuation methodologies depending on the characteristics of the assets being valued. Methods included discounted cash flows, relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings, quoted market prices and the direct cost method. Intangible assets include customer relationships and contracts, developed technology, the Westinghouse trade name and product development costs. Goodwill reflects the value assigned to the expected future earnings capabilities of the organization. This is the earnings potential that we anticipate will be realized through new business arrangements. The valuation of the assets and liabilities assumed was not finalized as of the date of these financial statements. The accounting for the acquisition will be revised when the valuation is complete. Following the completion of the valuation, if new information obtained within one year of the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition, identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition, further revisions will be made. B. Additional interest in Cigar Lake Joint Venture (CLJV) On May 19, 2022, Cameco and Orano Canada Inc. (Orano) completed the acquisition of Idemitsu Canada Resources Ltd.s (Idemitsu) 7.875 % participating interest in the CLJV by acquiring their pro rata shares through an asset purchase. Camecos ownership stake in the Cigar Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan is now 54.547 % (previously 50.025 %). The primary reason for the business combination was to increase our ownership interest. Cash consideration of $ 101,681,000 was paid for the additional 4.522 % interest. While Cameco received the economic benefit of owning the additional interest as of January 1, 2022, the additional interest has been proportionately consolidated with the results of Cameco commencing on May 19, 2022. CLJV allocates uranium production to each joint operation participant and the joint operation participant derives revenue directly from the sale of such product. Mining and milling expenses incurred by joint operations are included in the cost of inventory. As such, there is no revenue or profit or loss of the acquiree included in the consolidated statements of earnings. If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the year, Camecos share of production would have included an additional 296,000 pounds. The impact to the financial statements would not have been material. Acquisition costs of $ 1,495,000 have been included in administration expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022. Included in the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition are inputs, production processes and outputs. Therefore, Cameco has determined that together the acquired set is a business. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and quoted market prices. The values assigned to the net assets acquired were as follows: Property, plant and equipment $ 97,930 Deferred tax asset 28,196 Inventory 9,909 Working capital (24) Reclamation provision (2,528) Sales contracts (9,000) Net assts acquired $ 124,483 Cash paid 101,681 Bargain purchase gain [note 21] (a) $ 22,802 (a) The bargain purchase gain resulted from applying the measurement requirements under IFRS 3, Business Combinations . This standard requires the measurement of tax attributes that were acquired as part of the transaction be in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes , rather than at fair value. The measured amount of these attributes exceeded the amount paid for them and the resulting gain is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings."

In addition to direct borrowings under the facility, up to $ 100,000,000 can be used for the issuance of letters of credit and, to the extent necessary, it may be used to provide liquidity support for the Companys commercial paper program. The agreement also provides the ability to increase the revolving credit facility above $ 1,000,000,000 by increments no less than $ 50,000,000 , to a total of $ 1,250,000,000 . The facility ranks equally with all of Camecos other senior debt. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. Cameco has $ 1,771,663,000 (2022 - $ 1,756,754,000 ) in letter of credit facilities. Outstanding and committed letters of credit at December 31, 2023 amounted to $ 1,383,689,000 (2022 - $ 1,593,379,000 ), the majority of which relate to future decommissioning and reclamation liabilities (note 16). On November 7, 2023, the Company utilized a term loan for $ 600,000,000 (US) with a syndicate of lenders. The proceeds of the term loan were used to finance the 49 % acquisition of Westinghouse. The term loan consists of two $ 300,000,000 (US) tranches. The first tranche has a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 1.80 % and matures on November 7, 2025. The second tranche has a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 2.05 % and matures on November 7, 2026. Cameco is bound by a covenant in its revolving credit facility and term loan. The covenant requires a funded debt to tangible net worth ratio equal to or less than 1 :1. Non-compliance with this covenant could result in accelerated payment and termination of the revolving credit facility and term loan. At December 31, 2023, Cameco was in compliance with the covenant and does not expect its operating and investing activities in 2024 to be constrained by it.

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental executive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP), Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced benefits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered base plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets currently held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cameco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to eligible employees and their dependents. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for the Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 2,174,000 in contributions and letter of credit fees to its defined benefit plans in 2024. The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expose Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective date of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2021. The next planned effective date for valuations is January 1, 2024. Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis that these plans are not exposed to materially different risks. Information relating to Camecos defined benefit plans is shown in the following table: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans 2023 2022 2023 2022 Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 4,402 $ 5,693 $ - $ - Interest income on plan assets 201 157 - - Return on assets excluding interest income 18 (555) - - Benefits paid (901) (890) - - Administrative costs paid (3) (3) - - Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 3,717 $ 4,402 $ - $ - Defined benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 51,218 $ 69,998 $ 19,364 $ 24,697 Current service cost 1,567 2,302 689 915 Interest cost 2,527 1,867 987 726 Actuarial loss (gain) arising from: - financial assumptions 4,784 (20,913) 443 (5,881) - experience adjustment 1,559 1,396 18 161 Benefits paid (1,704) (3,666) (820) (1,254) Foreign exchange 87 234 - - Defined benefit obligation, end of year $ 60,038 $ 51,218 $ 20,681 $ 19,364 Defined benefit liability [note 15] $ (56,321) $ (46,816) $ (20,681) $ (19,364) The percentages of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset category at December 31 were as follows: Pension benefit plans 2023 2022 Asset category (a) Canadian equity securities 7% 6% U.S. equity securities 12% 11% Global equity securities 6% 6% Canadian fixed income 31% 28% Other (b) 44% 49% Total 100% 100% (a) The defined benefit plan assets contain no material amounts of related party assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.

A 1 % change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (7,739) $ 9,817 $ (2,143) $ 2,628 A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Camecos plans as at December 31, 2023. The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with the methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 1,583,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the defined benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Segmented information Cameco has three reportable segments: uranium, fuel services and Westinghouse. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies. The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium concentrate. The fuel services segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services. The Westinghouse segment reflects our earnings from this equity-accounted investment (see note 12). Westinghouse is a nuclear reactor technology original equipment manufacturer and a global provider of products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies. It provides outage and maintenance services, engineering support, instrumentation and controls equipment, plant modification, and components and parts to nuclear reactors. Cost of sales in the uranium segment includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that have had production suspensions as well as operational readiness costs for our operations that have resumed operations. Operational readiness costs include costs to complete critical projects, perform maintenance readiness checks, and recruit and train sufficient mine and mill personnel before beginning operations. Cameco expensed $ 50,615,000 of care and maintenance costs during the year (2022 - $ 218,439,000 of care and maintenance and operational readiness costs). Accounting policies used in each segment are consistent with the policies outlined in the summary of material accounting policies. A.

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes for assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data when available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow denominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency and interest rate contracts change. The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Companys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and retention of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates and pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects financial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cameco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a price for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuations because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign exchange risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 144,149 $ 7,207 Accounts receivable USD 371,618 18,581 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (302,364) (15,118) Long-term debt USD (786,397) (39,320) Net foreign currency derivatives USD 11,942 (102,567) A 5 % strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2023 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved policy limits. At December 31, 2023, the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 51 % (2022 - 92 %). Cameco was exposed to interest rate risk during the year through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 75,000,000 of the Series H senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. Under the terms of the swap, Cameco makes interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.3 % and receives fixed interest payments of 2.95 %. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of Camecos interest rate swap net liability was $ 5,819,000 (2022 - $ 7,284,000 ). Cameco is also exposed to interest rate risk through its term loan which consists of two $ 300,000,000 (US) tranches. The first tranche has a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 1.80 % and matures on November 7, 2025. The second tranche has a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 2.05 % and matures on November 7, 2026. Cameco measures its exposure to interest rate risk as the change in cash flows that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in interest rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined the impact on earnings of a 1 % increase in interest rate on its variable rate financial instruments to be as follows: Gain (loss) Interest rate contracts $ (760) Floating rate term loan (7,946) Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 566,809 $ 1,143,674 Short-term investments - 1,138,174 Accounts receivable [note 7] 415,561 178,088 Derivative assets [note 11] 28,467 2,807 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 566,809,000 at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $ 1,143,674,000 ). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Short-term investments Cameco held no short-term investments at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $ 1,138,174,000 ). The Company mitigates its credit risk by requiring that the issuer/guarantor of the investment have a minimum short-term credit rating and/or a long-term debt rating at the time of purchase, according to the investment credit ratings as issued by DBRS or S&amp;P, or the equivalent of the DBRS or S&amp;P rating at another reputable rating agency. In addition to the credit-rating requirement, Cameco also mitigates risk by prescribing limits by counterparty and types of investment products. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk related to short-term investments by applying historic default rates to outstanding investment balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non- payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the credit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre- payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 290,204 Non-investment grade credit rating 123,588 Total gross carrying amount $ 413,792 Loss allowance - Net $ 413,792 At December 31, 2023, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has not experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward- looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Camecos aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2023: Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 393,296 $ 2,366 395,662 1-30 days past due 16,531 889 17,420 More than 30 days past due 131 579 710 Total $ 409,958 $ 3,834 413,792 Liquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. The table below outlines the Companys available debt facilities at December 31, 2023: Outstanding and Total amount committed Amount available Unsecured revolving credit facility [note 14] $ 1,000,000 $ - $ 1,000,000 Letter of credit facilities [note 14] 1,771,663 1,383,689 387,974 The tables below present a maturity analysis of Camecos financial liabilities, including principal and interest, based on the expected cash flows from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date: Due in Carrying Contractual less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 amount cash flows 1 year years years years Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 577,550 $ 577,550 $ 577,550 $ - $ - $ - Long-term debt 1,784,174 1,794,580 500,000 794,580 400,000 100,000 Foreign currency contracts 16,525 16,525 11,762 4,763 - - Interest rate contracts 5,819 5,819 2,576 2,437 806 - Lease obligation [note 15] 10,816 12,937 2,300 3,332 2,617 4,688 Total contractual repayments $ 2,394,884 $ 2,407,411 $ 1,094,188 $ 805,112 $ 403,423 $ 104,688 Due in less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 Total 1 year years years years Total interest payments on long-term debt $ 299,775 $ 85,322 $ 121,213 $ 21,980 $ 71,260 Measurement of fair values A.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective November 1, 2023. Cameco retains full access to this cash. Cameco has issued guarantees to certain banks in respect of the credit facilities granted to various subsidiaries. These facilities consist of daily overdraft limits and credit lines. At December 31, 2023 the Company has issued guarantees of up to $ 278,006,000 ($ 209,927,000 (US)), which is the maximum amount the Company could be exposed to at any point in time. Cameco has not irrevocably designated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and level 2 fair value measurements of Camecos financial instruments: As at December 31, 2023 Carrying value Fair value Derivative assets [note 11] Foreign currency contracts $ 28,467 $ 28,467 Current portion of long-term debt [note 14] (499,821) (500,000) Derivative liabilities [note 15] Foreign currency contracts (16,525) (16,525) Interest rate contracts (5,819) (5,819) Long-term debt [note 14] (1,284,353) (1,303,681) Net $ (1,778,051) $ (1,797,558) As at December 31, 2022 Carrying value Fair value Derivative assets [note 11] Foreign currency contracts $ 2,807 $ 2,807 Derivative liabilities [note 15] Foreign currency contracts (51,058) (51,058) Interest rate contracts (7,284) (7,284) Long-term debt [note 14] (997,000) (1,014,010) Net $ (1,052,535) $ (1,069,545) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying values of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that are classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments and long-term debt at fair value. Derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 3.1 % to 4.9 % (2022 - 3.3 % to 4.2 %). The fair value of the floating rate term loan is equal to its carrying value. Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the difference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward interest rate curves. Where applicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date. Derivatives The following table summarizes the fair value of derivatives and classification on the consolidated statements of financial position: 2023 2022 Non-hedge derivatives: Foreign currency contracts $ 11,942 $ (48,251) Interest rate contracts (5,819) (7,284) Net $ 6,123 $ (55,535) Classification: Current portion of long-term receivables, investments and other [note 11] $ 9,137 $ 1,331 Long-term receivables, investments and other [note 11] 19,330 1,476 Current portion of other liabilities [note 15] (14,338) (25,913) Other liabilities [note 15] (8,006) (32,429) Net $ 6,123 $ (55,535) The following table summarizes the different components of the gains (losses) on derivatives included in net earnings: 2023 2022 Non-hedge derivatives: Foreign currency contracts $ 38,975 $ (66,360) Interest rate contracts (1,184) (6,589) Net $ 37,791 $ (72,949)"

The realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions during the periods in which the Companys deferred tax assets are available. The Company considers whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are available, realization of these deferred tax assets is probable and consequently the deferred tax assets have been recorded.

Tax rate reconciliation The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the combined expected federal and provincial income tax rate to earnings before income taxes.

Reassessments Canada On February 18, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada (Supreme Court) dismissed Canada Revenue Agencys (CRA) application for leave to appeal the June 26, 2020 decision of the Federal Court of Appeal (Court of Appeal). The dismissal means that the dispute for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years is fully and finally resolved in the Companys favour. In September 2018, the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) ruled that the marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, as well as the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium sales and purchasing agreements, were in full compliance with Canadian law for the tax years in question. Management believes the principles in the decision apply to all subsequent tax years, and that the ultimate resolution of those years will not be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution. Due to a revised CRA reassessment position for certain years, CRA has released approximately $ 86,000,000 of cash held on account (see note 11). As CRA continues to pursue reassessments for tax years subsequent to 2006, Cameco is utilizing its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules. G.

Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. When acquiring an additional interest in a joint arrangement, previously held interests are not remeasured at fair value. In an acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not constitute a business, the directly attributable transaction costs are included in the cost of the asset or group of assets."

Joint ventures i. Westinghouse Westinghouse is a nuclear reactor technology original equipment manufacturer and a global provider of products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies. Effective November 7, 2023, Cameco holds a 49 % interest and Brookfield holds 51 %. Cameco has joint control with Brookfield over the strategic operating, investing and financing activities of Westinghouse. The Company determined that the joint arrangement should be classified as a joint venture after concluding that neither the legal form of the separate entity, the terms of the contractual arrangement, or other facts and circumstances would give the Company rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. As a result, Cameco accounts for Westinghouse on an equity basis. Westinghouse provides outage and maintenance services, engineering support, instrumentation and controls equipment, plant modification, and components and parts to nuclear reactors. Westinghouse has three fabrication facilities that design and manufacture nuclear fuel supplies for light water reactors. In addition, Westinghouse designs, develops and procures equipment for the build of new nuclear reactor plants.

Global Laser Enrichment LLC (GLE) GLE is the exclusive licensee of the proprietary Separation of Isotopes by Laser Excitation (SILEX) laser enrichment technology, a third-generation uranium enrichment technology. Cameco owns a 49 % interest in GLE with an option to attain a majority interest of up to 75 % ownership. Cameco has joint control with SILEX over the strategic operating, investing and financing activities and as a result, accounts for GLE on an equity basis. In 2014, an impairment charge was recognized for its full carrying value of $ 183,615,000 . Following the impairment, under the equity method of accounting, Cameco discontinued recognizing its share of losses in GLE. Camecos contributions to GLE are recorded in earnings as research and development. B. Associate i. JV Inkai JV Inkai is the operator of the Inkai uranium deposit located in Kazakhstan. Cameco holds a 40 % interest and Kazatomprom holds a 60 % interest in JV Inkai. Cameco does not have joint control over the joint venture and as a result, Cameco accounts for JV Inkai on an equity basis. JV Inkai is a uranium mining and milling operation that utilizes in-situ recovery (ISR) technology to extract uranium. The participants in JV Inkai purchase uranium from Inkai and, in turn, derive revenue directly from the sale of such product to third- party customers.

Joint operations Cameco conducts a portion of its exploration, development, mining and milling activities through joint operations. Operations are governed by agreements that provide for joint control of the strategic operating, investing and financing activities among the partners. These agreements were considered in the determination of joint control. Camecos significant Canadian uranium joint operation interests are McArthur River, Key Lake and Cigar Lake. The Canadian uranium joint operations allocate uranium production to each joint operation participant and the joint operation participant derives revenue directly from the sale of such product.

Material accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 7, 2024. B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Companys functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. Amounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5. This summary of material accounting policies is a description of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. When acquiring an additional interest in a joint arrangement, previously held interests are not remeasured at fair value. In an acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not constitute a business, the directly attributable transaction costs are included in the cost of the asset or group of assets. iv. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in joint ventures and an associate. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Company has joint control, whereby it has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in the joint ventures and associate are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and OCI and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the joint ventures and associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with its equity- accounted investees JV Inkai and Westinghouse are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the average monthly exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non- monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the average monthly exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at the average monthly exchange rate at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole, the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are measured at amortized cost. F. Short-term investments Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are measured at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized using the units of production method over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue, using the effective interest method. Finance costs are comprised of interest and fees on borrowings and unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i. Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost. i. Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products, except in limited circumstances. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered. R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another. Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. i. Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. The Companys financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. The Companys financial assets measured at FVTPL include foreign currency contracts. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. The Companys financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease obligations and long- term debt. The Companys financial liabilities measured at FVTPL include foreign currency contracts and interest rate contracts. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. While Cameco does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2023 and 2022, its equity-investee Westinghouse does. These cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income. S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team. Cameco has three reportable segments, uranium, fuel services and Westinghouse. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill."

Cameco also agreed to lend to Orano up to 1,148,200 kgU of conversion supply and up to an additional 1,200,000 pounds of uranium concentrate over the period 2022 to 2024. Repayment to Cameco is to be made in kind with U 3 O 8 quantities drawn being repaid by December 31, 2027 and quantities of UF 6 drawn by December 31, 2035 . As at December 31, 2023, 3,600,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 (December 31, 2022 - 3,571,001 pounds) and 1,148,200 kgU of UF 6 conversion supply (December 31, 2022 - 700,000 kgU) were drawn on the loans and are recorded at Camecos weighted average cost of inventory."

Reclamation provision Cameco's estimates of future decommissioning obligations are based on reclamation standards that satisfy regulatory requirements. Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future decommissioning and reclamation costs for its existing operating assets to be $ 1,356,018,000 (2022 - $ 1,356,092,000 ). The expected timing of these outflows is based on life-of-mine plans with the majority of expenditures expected to occur after 2027 . These estimates are reviewed by Cameco technical personnel as required by regulatory agencies or more frequently as circumstances warrant. In connection with future decommissioning and reclamation costs, Cameco has provided financial assurances of $ 1,060,769,000 (2022 - $ 1,035,348,000 ) in the form of letters of credit to satisfy current regulatory requirements. The reclamation provision relates to the following segments: 2023 2022 Uranium $ 874,773 $ 870,877 Fuel services 176,394 190,219 Total $ 1,051,167 $ 1,061,096 B. Waste disposal The fuel services segment consists of the Blind River refinery, Port Hope conversion facility and Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.. The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium contaminated waste. These include contaminated combustible material (paper, rags, gloves, etc.) and contaminated non-combustible material (metal parts, soil from excavations, building and roofing materials, spent uranium concentrate drums, etc.). These materials can in some instances be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 9,681,000 (2022 - $ 8,919,000 ). The majority of these expenditures are expected to occur within the next three years ."

Related parties A. Transactions with key management personnel Key management personnel are those persons that have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company, directly or indirectly. Key management personnel of the Company include executive officers, vice-presidents, other senior managers and members of the board of directors. In addition to their salaries, Cameco also provides non-cash benefits to executive officers and vice-presidents and contributes to pension plans on their behalf (note 26). Senior management and directors also participate in the Companys share-based compensation plans (note 25). Executive officers are subject to terms of notice ranging from three to six months. Upon resignation at the Companys request, they are entitled to termination benefits of up to the lesser of 18 to 24 months or the period remaining until age 65. The termination benefits include gross salary plus the target short-term incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs.

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based on a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and therefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery. Cameco expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period is less than a year. The following table summarizes Camecos sales disaggregated by geographical region and contract type and includes a reconciliation to the Companys reportable segments (note 29): For the year ended December 31, 2023 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 1,043,475 $ 307,885 $ 9,959 $ 1,361,319 Europe 592,068 88,759 - 680,827 Asia 516,699 28,913 - 545,612 $ 2,152,242 $ 425,557 $ 9,959 $ 2,587,758 Contract type Fixed-price $ 821,958 $ 414,289 $ 9,959 $ 1,246,206 Market-related 1,330,284 11,268 - 1,341,552 $ 2,152,242 $ 425,557 $ 9,959 $ 2,587,758 For the year ended December 31, 2022 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 806,915 $ 289,028 $ 20,025 $ 1,115,968 Europe 284,602 52,112 2,769 339,483 Asia 388,629 23,923 - 412,552 $ 1,480,146 $ 365,063 $ 22,794 $ 1,868,003 Contract type Fixed-price $ 478,552 $ 355,479 $ 22,794 $ 856,825 Market-related 1,001,594 9,584 - 1,011,178 $ 1,480,146 $ 365,063 $ 22,794 $ 1,868,003 Deferred sales The following table provides information about contract liabilities (note 15) from contracts with customers: 2023 2022 Beginning of year $ 66,845 $ 23,316 Additions 25,935 45,978 Recognized in revenue (47,403) (2,463) Effect of movements in exchange rates (5) 14 End of year $ 45,372 $ 66,845 Deferred sales primarily relates to advance consideration received from customers for future uranium and conversion deliveries as well as revenue related to the storage of uranium and converted uranium held at Cameco facilities. The revenue related to storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future uranium and conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 2024 and 2030. Cameco recognized a decrease of revenue of $ 648,000 (2022 - decrease of revenue of $ 194,000 ) during 2023 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This is due to the difference between actual pricing indices and the estimates at the time of invoicing. Future sales commitments Camecos sales portfolio consists of short and long-term sales commitments. The contracts can be executed well in advance of a delivery and include both fixed and market-related pricing. The following table summarizes the expected future revenue, by segment, related to only fixed-price contracts with remaining future deliveries as follows: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Uranium $ 676,996 $ 756,597 $ 406,045 $ 367,194 $ 349,872 $ 565,998 $ 3,122,702 Fuel services 356,742 397,922 383,045 356,792 333,166 1,474,806 3,302,473 Total $ 1,033,738 $ 1,154,519 $ 789,090 $ 723,986 $ 683,038 $ 2,040,804 $ 6,425,175 The sales contracts are denominated largely in US dollars and converted from US to Canadian dollars at a rate of $ 1.30 . The amounts in the table represent the consideration the Company will be entitled to receive when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing. The Company has elected to exclude these amounts from the table as the transaction price will not be known until the time of delivery.

Share-based compensation plans The Company has the following plans: A. Stock option plan The Company has established a stock option plan under which options to purchase common shares may be granted to employees of Cameco. Options granted under the stock option plan have an exercise price of not less than the closing price quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options carry vesting periods of one to three years , and expire eight years from the date granted. The aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Cameco stock option plan shall not exceed 43,017,198 of which 32,196,059 shares have been issued. Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2023 2022 Beginning of year 3,053,571 3,458,001 Options granted - - Options expired - (2,475) Options exercised [note 17] (1,657,282) (401,955) End of year 1,396,289 3,053,571 Exercisable 1,396,289 3,053,571 Weighted average share prices were as follows: 2023 2022 Beginning of year $15.75 $16.72 Options granted - - Options expired - 26.81 Options exercised 16.62 23.96 End of year $14.73 $15.75 Exercisable $14.73 $15.75 The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise during 2023 was $ 45.19 per share (2022 - $ 30.88 ). Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2023 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $ 11.32 - 14.7 0 658,804 1.3 $14.08 658,804 $14.08 $ 14.71 - 16.38 737,485 3.0 $15.32 737,485 $15.32 1,396,289 1,396,289 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from February 29, 2024 to February 28, 2027. B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the participants discretion provided they have met their ownership requirements, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period is based on Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . If the participant elects a cash payout, the redemption amount will be based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Camecos common shares on March 1 or, if March 1 is not a trading day, on the first trading day following March 1. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of PSUs held by the participants, after adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 830,279 (2022 - 1,255,255 ). C. Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. These same participants, if they have met or are not subject to share ownership requirements, may elect to have their award paid as a lump sum cash amount. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 814,683 (2022 - 1,131,493 ). D. Phantom stock option The Company has established a phantom stock option plan for eligible non-North American employees. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2023, the number of options held by participating employees was 45,551 (2022 - 94,135 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.61 to $ 15.27 per share (2022 - $ 11.32 to $ 19.30 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 12.29 (2022 - $ 12.55 ). E. Phantom restricted share unit (PRSU) The Company has established a PRSU plan whereby it provides non-North American employees an annual grant of PRSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PRSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of cash with an equivalent market value. The PRSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of PRSUs held by the participants was 28,000 (2022 - 21,148 ). F. Employee share ownership plan Cameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contribution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each employee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2023, there were 2,838 participants in the plan (2022 - 2,603 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2023 with Company contributions was 100,379 (2022 - 116,530 ). In 2023, the Companys contributions totaled $ 4,460,000 (2022 - $ 3,541,000 ). G. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with the balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be redeemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the director. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of DSUs held by participating directors was 564,401 (2022 - 547,304 ). Equity-settled plans Cameco records compensation expense under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed surplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2023 2022 Employee share ownership plan $ 4,460 $ 3,541 Restricted share unit plan 3,692 3,273 Stock option plan - 45 Total $ 8,152 $ 6,859 Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled RSU plan were as follows: Grant date Mar 1/23 Number of options granted 129,623 Average strike price $37.30 Expected forfeitures 11% Weighted average grant date fair values $37.30 Cash-settled plans Cameco has recognized the following expenses under its cash-settled plans: 2023 2022 Performance share unit plan $ 22,013 $ 11,221 Restricted share unit plan 19,045 9,342 Deferred share unit plan 15,447 2,811 Phantom stock option plan 1,908 751 Phantom restricted share unit plan 812 244 Total $ 59,225 $ 24,369 At December 31, 2023, a liability of $ 79,771,000 (2022 - $ 59,577,000 ) was included in the consolidated statement of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and projections of the non-market criteria. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. The phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the March 1, 2023 grant date were as follows: Phantom PSU RSU RSU Number of units 232,160 162,930 9,997 Expected vesting 83% - - Expected life of option 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected forfeitures 9% 8% 8% Weighted average measurement date fair values $37.30 $37.30 $37.30 The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the reporting date were as follows: Phantom Phantom stock options PSU RSU RSU Number of units 45,551 830,279 561,210 28,000 Expected vesting - 70% - - Average strike price $12.29 - - - Expected dividend $0.12 - - $0.12 Expected volatility 48% - - - Risk-free interest rate 3.5% - - - Expected life of option 3.4 years 0.8 years 1.0 years 1.0 years Expected forfeitures 7% 2% 8% 8% Weighted average measurement date fair values $46.08 $57.13 $57.13 $57.13 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The non- market criteria relating to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at both grant and reporting date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets."

Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

Lease s Commencing in 2019 (see note 8 ), Cameco recognizes a right-of -use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any init ial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflect s that the Company will exer cise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be deprec iated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment . The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if th at rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate . Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Cameco s existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or exte nsion option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised . Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the C ompany is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized .

Non- derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to life time ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are m easured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effor t. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default whe n the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental eff ect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company woul d not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market for a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted fro m the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of re covering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof ."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such i ndication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration p roperties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the C ompany in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exp loration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of c onfidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation asse ts attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of I FRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment."

Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for sit e closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and deco mmissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and re storation activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the enviro nment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deri ving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissio ning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimat es. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Revenue is measured based on the consideration specif ied in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pu rsuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation unde r the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Convert ers) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account a t the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a con tractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Cameco s Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Cameco s Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractual ly obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in th e sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over ti me, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In ot her contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Ca meco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered ."

The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by cre ating an offset between changes in t he fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a forei gn currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation.

Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of cur rent and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payabl e or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amou nt expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purp oses. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied b y the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is reco gnized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is proba ble that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a re reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize."

Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint vent ure. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabil ities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consoli dated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accor dance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicl e. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, wher eby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The shar e of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases."

Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of shar e-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market pe rformance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitle d to payment. The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equit y-settled plans at the ti me they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the mod ified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fa ir value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value . Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the sec ond plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased."

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an empl oyee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the prese nt value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and ma nagement's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out flows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuar ial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the exten t that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension p lans.

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estima tes are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Furthe r details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plan t and equipment, and intangible assets when there is an indication of possible impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use or with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually. If it is determined that carrying values of assets or goodwill cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements and min eral reserves. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generati ng units In performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other a ssets or groups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the e nd of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs , timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. I ncome taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated fin ancial statements. In calculating income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates defe rred income taxes based on temporary differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is de pendent on assumptions and judg ments regarding future market conditions, production rates and intercompany sales , which can materially impact estimated future taxable income . If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earn ings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equip ment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates o f life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amo unts of depreciation charged to earnings. F. Gain on restructuring The gain recorded on the restructuring of JV Inkai was calculated based on the fair value of the asset being given up. The determination of fair value requires Cameco to make assumptions, estimates and judgments, some of which are inherently subjective ."

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes fo r assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data whe n available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants w ould use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inpu ts that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair valu e measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measuremen t in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not ha ve any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 24 - Share-based compensation plans Note 26 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income , or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business mo del for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or lo ss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest o n the principal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend c learly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the ef fective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair val ue. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss."

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based o n a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and t herefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery . Cameco expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period is less than a year.

The revenue related to the fuel fabrication services and storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 2020 and 2025 . Cameco recognized $ 78,000 of revenue ( 2018 - $ 5,468,00 0 reduction of revenue) during 2019 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This is due to the difference between actual pricing indices and the estimates at the time of invoicing. Future sales commitments Ca m ecos sales portfolio consists of short and long-term sales commitments. The contracts can be executed well in advance of a delivery and include both fixed and market-related pricing.

The amounts in the table represent the consideration the Company will be entitled to receive when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing.

Share-based compensation plans The Company has the following equity-settled plans: A. Stock option plan T he Company has established a stock option plan under which options to purchase common shares may be granted to employees of Cameco. Options granted under the stock option plan have an exercise price of not less than the closing price quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options carry vesting periods of one to three years, and expire eight years from the date granted . The aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Cameco stock option plan shall not exceed 43,017,198 of which 27,875 ,28 9 shares have been issued. Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2019 2018 Beginning of year 8,820,805 8,324,666 Options granted 886,740 1,473,430 Options forfeited (270,025) (315,340) Options expired (815,423) (661,951) Options exercised [note 16] (5,000) - End of year 8,617,097 8,820,805 Exercisable 6,290,380 6,007,557 Weighted average exercise prices were as follows: 2019 2018 Beginning of year $19.75 $22.19 Options granted 15.27 11.32 Options forfeited 22.59 25.43 Options expired 38.43 28.90 Options exercised 16.38 - End of year $17.44 $19.75 Exercisable $18.90 $22.83 Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2019 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $11.32 - 15.83 3,733,210 5.7 $13.50 1,406,493 $13.52 $15.84 - 26.81 4,883,887 1.9 $20.45 4,883,887 $20.45 8,617,097 6,290,380 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from May 14, 2020 to February 28, 2027. B . Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the bo ard. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of ea ch normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2019 , the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 443,274, ( 2018 - 456,704 ). C. Employee share ownership plan Cameco also has an employee share ownership p lan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contribution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in th e program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each employee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contribu tions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2019 , there were 2,253 participants in the plan ( 2018 - 2,317 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2019 with Company contributions was 235,915 ( 2018 - 304,147 ). In 2019 , the Companys contributions totaled $ 3,127,000 ( 2018 - $ 3,845,000 ). Cameco records compensation expense under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed s urplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2019 2018 Stock option plan $ 4,418 $ 4,744 Performance share unit plan (a) 7,245 7,690 Restricted share unit plan 2,679 2,542 Employee share ownership plan 3,127 3,845 Total $ 17,469 $ 18,821 (a) In the fourth quarter, the performance share unit plan was amended to allow eligible participants to elect payout of their grants in cash or shares, provided they have met their share ownership requirements. As a result, this plan is now considered cash-settled. This amount represents the expense recorded prior to the plan modification. Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the performance share unit plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and t he fair value of options granted under the stock option plan was measured based on the Black -Scholes option-pricing model. T he fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement o f the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment plans were as follows: Stock option plan PSU RSU Number of options granted 886,740 477,250 212,496 Expected vesting - 106% - Average strike price $15.27 - $15.33 Expected dividend $0.08 - - Expected volatility 36% 38% - Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.8% - Expected life of option 4.9 years 3.0 years - Expected forfeitures 7% 12% 15% Weighted average grant date fair values $4.92 $15.33 $15.33 The Company has the following cash-settled plans: A. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with the balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be redeemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the d irector. As of December 31, 2019 , the total number of DSUs held by participating direc tors was 474,266 ( 2018 - 528,483 ). B. Ex ecutive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the participants discretion, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period will be based on total shareholder return over the three years, Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether t he participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . If the participant elects a cash payout, the redemption amount will be based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Camecos common shares on March 1 or, if March 1 is not a trading day, on the first trading day following March 1. As of December 31, 2019 , the total number of PSUs held by the participants, after adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,465,618 ( 2018 - 1,343,971 ). C. Phant om stock option Cameco makes annual grants of bonuses to eligible non-North American employees in the form of phantom stock options. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option pla n have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of De cember 31, 2019 , the number of options held by participating employees was 406,270 ( 2018 - 353,580 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.32 to $ 26.81 per share ( 2018 - $ 11.32 to $ 39.53 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 16.48 ( 2018 - $ 17.74 ). Cameco has recognized the following expenses (recoveries) under its cash-settled plans: 2019 2018 Deferred share unit plan $ (1,001) $ 2,922 Performance share unit plan (a) - - Phantom stock option plan (436) 675 Total $ (1,437) $ 3,597 (a) The modification to the PSU plan resulted in a reclassification, at the date of modification, of $ 8,369,000 from equity to liabilities. The liability recognized on the date of the modification was less than the amount previously recognized as an increase in equity. Since the plan modification did not change the performance and vesting criteria, no incremental fair value was granted. At December 31, 2019 , a liability of $ 14,577,000 ( 2018 - $ 9,352,000 ) was included in the consolidated statem ents of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and the fair va lue of the phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-se ttled share-based payment plans at the grant and reporting dates were as follows: PSUs Phantom stock options Grant date Reporting date Grant date Reporting date Mar 1, 2019 Dec 31, 2019 Mar 1, 2019 Dec 31, 2019 Number of units 477,250 1,465,618 68,890 406,720 Expected vesting 106% 80% - - Average strike price - - $15.27 $16.48 Expected dividend - - $0.08 $0.08 Expected volatility 38% 31% 37% 35% Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.7% 1.5% 1.7% Expected life of option 3.0 years 1.4 years 4.5 years 4.0 years Expected forfeitures 12% 10% 8% 8% Weighted average measurement date fair values $15.33 $10.07 $5.07 $2.14 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The market condition based on total shareholder return was incorporated by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. The non-market criteria relating to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at both grant and reporting date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets."

The realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions during the periods in which the Companys deferred t ax assets are available. The Company considers whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets w ill not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are available, realization of these deferred tax assets is probable and consequently the deferred tax assets have been recorded .

Reassessments Canada In 2008, as part of the ongoing annual audits of Cameco's Canadian tax returns, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) disputed the transfer pricing structure and methodology used by Cameco and its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Cameco Europe Ltd., in respect of sale and purchase agreements for uranium products. From December 2008 to date, CRA issued notices of reassessment for the taxation years 2003 through 2013, which in aggregate have increased Cameco's income for Canadian tax purpos es by approximately $ 5,700,000,000 . CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2011 in the amount of $ 371,000,000 . It is uncertain whether CRA will reassess Cameco's tax returns for subsequent year s on a similar basis and if these will require Cameco to make future remittances or provide security on receipt of the reassessments . On September 26 , 2018 , the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) ruled in our favour in our case with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years . The Tax Court ruled that our marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries and the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium purchase and sale agreements were in full compliance with Canadian laws for the three tax years in question. While the dec ision applies only to the three tax years in question , we believe there is nothing in the decision that would warrant a materially different o utcome for subsequent tax ye ars . We expect to recover any amounts remitted or secured as a result of the reassessments . On October 25, 2018, CRA filed a notice of appeal with the Federal Court of Appeal. We anticipate that it will take about two years from the start of the appeal pro cess to receive a decision from the Federal Court of Appeal . We expect the Tax Courts decision to be upheld on appeal. We expect any further actions regarding the tax years 2007 through 2013 will be suspended until the three years covered in th e decision are finally resolved . Despite the fact that we believe there is no basis to do so, and it is not our view of the likely outcome, CRA may continue to reassess us using the methodology it used to reassess the 2003 through 2013 tax years . In that scenario, an d including the $ 5,700,000,000 already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $ 8,700,000,000 for the years 2003 through 2019, which would increase Camecos income for Canadian tax purposes and result in a rela ted tax expense of approximately $ 2,600,000,000 . In addition to penalties already imposed, CRA may continue to apply penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2011. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties would be between $ 1 ,950,000,000 and $ 2,150,000,000 . In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to Cameco. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise securing 50 % of the cash taxes and tra nsfer pricing penalties (between $ 970,000,000 and $ 1,070,000,000 ), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to Cameco . Under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be remitted each year wil l depend on the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions. CRA disallowed the use of any loss carry-backs to be applied to any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to CRA, including cash taxes, interest and penalties totalling $ 303,222,000 already paid as at December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018 - $ 303,222,000 ) (note 10 ). In addition to the cash remitted, we have provided $ 480,000,000 in letters of credit to secure 50 % of the cash taxes and related interest. Management believes that the ultimate resolution will not be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations or liquidit y in the year(s) of resolution. Resolution of this matter as stipulated by CRA would be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution and other unfavourable outcomes for the years 2003 to date coul d be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolutio n .

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 6 , 2020 . B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Companys functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars , unless otherwise noted. A mounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost ba sis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods a ffected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5 . This summary of significant accounting policies is a desc ription of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been app lied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goo dwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired an d liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previ ously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair val ue, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instrume nts. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the d ate on which control is acquired by the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subse quently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint vent ure. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabil ities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consoli dated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accor dance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicl e. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, wher eby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The shar e of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions , and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investm ent to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statem ents are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that ar e measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of forei gn exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, inc luding goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the date s of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole , the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the g ain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are classified as at amortized cost . F. Short-term investment s Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are classified as at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and e quipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds fr om disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the comme rcial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the product ion stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are de termined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstrati on of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as sub stantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset ente rs the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount o f the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired . At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the ec onomic benefits of the business combination . Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently a t cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite us eful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Lease s Commencing in 2019 (see note 8 ), Cameco recognizes a right-of -use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any init ial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflect s that the Company will exer cise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be deprec iated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment . The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if th at rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate . Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Cameco s existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or exte nsion option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised . Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the C ompany is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized . The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term . K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on f unds invested . Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue , using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on pr ovisions and costs incurred on redemption of debentures . Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expend itures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i. Non- derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to life time ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are m easured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effor t. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default whe n the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental eff ect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company woul d not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market for a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted fro m the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of re covering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof . ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such i ndication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration p roperties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the C ompany in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exp loration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of c onfidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation asse ts attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of I FRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation tha t can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost . i. Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for sit e closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and deco mmissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and re storation activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the enviro nment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deri ving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissio ning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimat es. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has est ablished strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an empl oyee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the prese nt value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and ma nagement's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out flows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuar ial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the exten t that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on t he employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension p lans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit oblig ations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation t o pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date , or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when t he Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of shar e-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market pe rformance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitle d to payment. The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equit y-settled plans at the ti me they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the mod ified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fa ir value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value . Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the sec ond plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Revenue is measured based on the consideration specif ied in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pu rsuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation unde r the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Convert ers) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account a t the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a con tractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Cameco s Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Cameco s Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractual ly obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in th e sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over ti me, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In ot her contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Ca meco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered . R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another . Trade receivables and debt s ecurities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade recei vable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade re ceivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price . i. Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income , or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business mo del for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or lo ss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest o n the principal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend c learly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the ef fective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair val ue. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Derivative financi al instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host c ontract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. D erivative fi nancial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transact ion costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss . The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by cre ating an offset between changes in t he fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a forei gn currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of cur rent and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payabl e or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amou nt expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purp oses. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied b y the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is reco gnized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is proba ble that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a re reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize. T. Shar e capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adju sting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstandi ng options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate dilut ed earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any o f the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team . Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill."

Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate."

Accounting standards A. Changes in accounting policy On January 1, 2019 , Cameco adopted the new standard, IFRS 16, Leases (IFRS 16) and the interpretation, IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (IFRIC 23) as issued by the IASB . i. Leases IFRS 16 eliminates the dual model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to finance le ase accounting under IAS 17 . Cameco adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach which does not require comparat ive information to be restated. The following practical expedients were used during initial application:  No reassessment of whether a contract i s, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed for whether there is a lease under IFRS 16 ;  Reliance on an assessment under IAS 37 for onerous contracts as an alternative to perf orming an impairment review;  No recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application or for leases of low value assets; and  Use of hindsight when determining the lea se terms. When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating, lease payments were discounted using Camecos incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019, which was 4.65%. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact o n the consolidated financial statements. See notes 8 , 14 and 26 . ii. Income tax IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the accounting for current and deferred tax liabilities and assets in circumstances in which there is uncertainty over income tax treatm ents. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements:"

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will aff ect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow d enominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency , interest rate and comm odity contracts change . The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Compan ys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and rete ntion of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates an d pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects finan cial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cam eco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a p rice for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuatio ns because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign excha nge risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 120,675 $ 6,034 Accounts receivable USD 280,877 14,044 Net foreign currency derivatives USD (4,333) (30,851) A 5% strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2019 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its expo sure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved pol icy limits. At December 31, 2019 , the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 85 % ( 2018 - 67 %). Cameco is exposed to interest rate risk through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 150,000,000 of the Series E senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. The Series E swaps terminate on November 14, 2022. Under the terms of the swaps, Cameco makes interest payments based on the three-month Ca nada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.2 % and receives fixed interest payments of 3.75 %. The Series D swaps terminate d on September 2, 2019. At December 31, 2019 , the fair value of Cam ecos interest rate swap net asset was $ 2,313,000 ( 2018 - $ 856 ,000 ). Cameco measures its exposure to interest rate risk as the change in cash flows that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in interest rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has d etermined the impact on earnings of a 1 % increase in interest rate on its interest rate contracts to be a loss of $ 1,524,000 . Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,062,431 $ 711,528 Short-term investments - 391,025 Accounts receivable [note 6] 323,430 398,639 Advances receivable from JV Inkai [note 31] - 124,533 Derivative assets [note 10] 10,504 3,881 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 1,062 ,000,000 at December 31, 2019 ( 2018 - $ 712 ,000,000). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credi t risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non-payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the c redit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre-payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 244,315 Non-investment grade credit rating 77,323 Total gross carrying amount $ 321,638 Loss allowance - Net $ 321,638 At December 31, 2019 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has no t experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward-looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Cameco s aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2019 : Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 274,249 $ 5,306 279,555 1-30 days past due 39,690 1,221 40,911 More than 30 days past due 301 871 1,172 Total $ 314,240 $ 7,398 321,638 L iquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term bu siness requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective July 1, 2018. Cameco retains full access to this cash . The investments in equity securities represent investments that Cameco intends to hold for the long-term for strategic purposes. As permitted by IFRS 9, these investments have been desi gnated at the date of initial application as measured at FVOCI. The accumulated fair value reserve related to these investments will never be reclassified to profit or loss. Cameco has not irrevocably designated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of Camecos financial instrument s, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy: As at December 31, 2019 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 8,191 $ - $ 8,191 $ 8,191 Interest rate contracts 2,313 - 2,313 2,313 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 24,408 24,408 - 24,408 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (12,524) - (12,524) (12,524) Long-term debt [note 13] (996,718) - (1,111,923) (1,111,923) Net $ (974,330) $ 24,408 $ (1,113,943) $ (1,089,535) As at December 31, 2018 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 2,201 $ - $ 2,201 $ 2,201 Interest rate contracts 1,680 - 1,680 1,680 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 28,916 28,916 - 28,916 Current portion of long-term debt [note 13] (499,599) - (511,210) (511,210) Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (54,866) - (54,866) (54,866) Interest rate contracts (823) - (823) (823) Uranium contracts (5,698) - (5,698) (5,698) Long-term debt [note 13] (996,072) - (1,111,782) (1,111,782) Net $ (1,524,261) $ 28,916 $ (1,680,498) $ (1,651,582) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying value of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates its fair value as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that ar e classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments, material investments in equity securities, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt at fai r value. Investments in publicly held equity securities are classified as a recurring level 1 fair value measurement while derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity securities is determined using quoted share prices observed in the principal market for the securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 1.7 % to 1.8 % ( 2018 - 1.9 % to 2.2 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the d ifference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward in terest rate curves. Uranium contract derivative s consist of price swaps. The fair value of uranium price swaps is determined by discounting e xpected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed purchases or sales under contracted prices, and floating purchases or sales based on Numerco forward uranium price curves. The swaps were settled during the year so there were none outstanding at the reporting date. Where ap plicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date.

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental execu tive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP) , Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced ben efits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered bas e plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets curren tly held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cam eco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to elig ible employees and their depende nts. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for th e Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1,106 ,000 in contribution s and letter of credit fees to i ts defined benefit plans in 2020 . The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expo se Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective da te of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2018 . The next planned effective date f or valuations is January 1, 2021 . Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis tha t these plans are not exposed to materially different risks.

A 1% change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (8,141) $ 10,595 $ (3,284) $ 4,133 Rate of compensation increase 2,832 (2,608) n/a n/a A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Cameco s plans as at December 31, 2019 . The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with t he methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 1,621 ,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the defined benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes fo r assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data whe n available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants w ould use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inpu ts that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair valu e measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measuremen t in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not ha ve any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 24 - Share-based compensation plans Note 26 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for m anaging its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not de signated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and loss es and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is he ld within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the pri ncipal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses a re re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to presen t subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly re presents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FV TPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be dere cognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is design ated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized co st using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged o r cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recogni zed at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss."

For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditio nally become entitled to payment.

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental execu tive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP) , Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced ben efits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered bas e plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets curren tly held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cam eco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to elig ible employees and their depende nts. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for th e Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1 ,785 ,000 in contribution s and letter of credit fees to i ts defined benefit plans in 2021 . The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expo se Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective da te of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2018 . The next planned effective date f or valuations is January 1, 2021 . Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis tha t these plans are not exposed to materially different risks.

A 1% change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (9,778) $ 12,766 $ (3,270) $ 4,138 Rate of compensation increase 3,009 (2,772) n/a n/a A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Cameco s plans as at December 31, 2020 . The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in de termining the above sensitivity are consistent with the methods and assumptions used in the previous year. I n addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit ob ligation by $ 2,030 ,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the define d benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depr eciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity)."

Reassessments Canada In 2008, as part of the ongoing annual audits of Cameco's Canadian tax returns, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) disputed the transfer pricing structure and methodology used by Cameco and its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Cameco Europe Ltd., in respect of sale and purchase agreements for uranium products. From December 2008 to date, CRA issued notices of reassessment for the taxation years 2003 through 2014 , which in aggregate have increased Cameco's income for Canadian tax purposes by approximately $ 6 ,6 00,000,000 . CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2011 in the amount of $ 371,000,000 . On June 26, 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal (Court of Appeal) released it s decision in the Companys dispute with CRA . The Court of Appeal decision upholds the September 26 , 2018 decision of the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) which ruled in Camecos favour for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years . The Court of Appeal decision upheld the Tax Court rul ing that our marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries and the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium purchase and sale agreements were in full compl iance with Canadian laws for the three tax years in question. Management believes the principles in the decision apply to all subsequent tax years . On October 30, 2020, Cameco received notice that CRA made an application to the Supreme Court of Canada (Supreme Court) to seek leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the appeal or decline CRAs request for leave. If the appeal proceeds, Cameco estimates that it could take until the second half of 2022 before a decision is rendere d by the Supreme Court . Despite the fact that Cameco believe s there is no basis to do so, and it is not the Companys view of the likely outcome , CRA may continue to reassess Cameco using the methodology it reassess ed the 2003 through 2014 tax years . In that scenario, and including the $ 6 ,6 00,000,000 already reassessed, the Company could receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $ 8,700,000,000 for the years 2003 through 2020 , which would increase Camecos related tax expense by approximately $ 2,600,000,000 . In addition to penalties already imposed, CRA may continue to a pply penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2011. In that case, Cameco estimates that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties would be between $ 1,950,000,000 and $ 2,150,000,000 . In addition, CRA may seek to apply interest and instalment penalties that would be material to Cameco. While in dispute, Cameco would be required to remit or otherwise secure 50 % of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $ 970,000,000 and $ 1,070,000,000 ), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, w hich would be material to the Company. Cameco expects further actions regarding the tax years 2007 through 2014 will be suspended until the three years covered in the decision are finally resolved. CRA has recently proposed an alternative reassessing position for the 2014 tax year but has not reassessed on this basis. Management believes that the ultimate resolution will not be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution. However, r esolution of this matter as stipulated by CRA would be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution and other unfavourable outcomes for the years 2003 to date could be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolutio n. If CRA continues to pursue reassessments for tax years su bsequent to 2006, Cameco will continue to utilize its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rule s . G.

Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, r eclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence condit ions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates a re involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the recla mation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provi sion resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will aff ect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow d enominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency , interest rate and comm odity contracts change . The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Compan ys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and rete ntion of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates an d pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects finan cial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cam eco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a p rice for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuatio ns because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign excha nge risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 86,985 $ 4,349 Accounts receivable USD 136,894 6,845 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (72,576) (3,629) Net foreign currency derivatives USD 40,872 (38,811) A 5% strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2020 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its expo sure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved pol icy limits. At December 31, 2020 , the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 100 % ( 2019 - 85 %). Cameco wa s exposed to interest rate risk during the year through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed r ate payments on a notional amount of $ 150,000,000 of the Series E senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. The Series E swaps were set to terminate on November 14, 2022 however with the early retirement of these debentures, the swaps terminated on November 16 , 2020 (see note 13 ). Under the terms of the swaps, Cameco ma de interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1. 2 % and receive d fixed interest payments of 3.75 %. At the time of the termination of the Series E swaps, the fair value of the interest rate swap net asset was $ 7,330,000 . The Series D swaps terminate d on September 2, 2019. At December 31, 2020 , the fair value of Cam ecos interest rate swap net asset was nil ( 2019 - $ 2,313,000 ) . Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 918,382 $ 1,062,431 Short-term investments 24,985 - Accounts receivable [note 6] 166,788 323,430 Derivative assets [note 10] 45,605 10,504 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 918 ,000,000 at December 31, 2020 ( 2019 - $ 1,062 ,000,000). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credi t risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non-payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the c redit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre-payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 160,093 Non-investment grade credit rating 5,961 Total gross carrying amount $ 166,054 Loss allowance - Net $ 166,054 At December 31, 2020 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has no t experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward-looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Cameco s aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2020 : Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 159,280 $ 3,649 162,929 1-30 days past due 133 434 567 More than 30 days past due 2,043 515 2,558 Total $ 161,456 $ 4,598 166,054 L iquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term bu siness requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. The table below outlines the Companys available debt facilities at December 31, 2020: Outstanding and Total amount committed Amount available Unsecured revolving credit facility $ 1,000,000 $ - $ 1,000,000 Letter of credit facilities [note 13] 1,698,340 1,596,488 101,852 The tables below present a maturity analysis of Camecos financial liabilities, including principal and interest, based on the expected cash flows from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date: Due in Carrying Contractual less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 amount cash flows 1 year years years years Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 233,649 $ 233,649 $ 233,649 $ - $ - $ - Long-term debt 995,541 1,000,000 - - 500,000 500,000 Foreign currency contracts 4,733 4,733 1,658 3,075 - - Lease obligation [note 14] 7,951 8,525 3,657 3,896 972 - Total contractual repayments $ 1,241,874 $ 1,246,907 $ 238,964 $ 6,971 $ 500,972 $ 500,000 Due in less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 Total 1 year years years years Total interest payments on long-term debt $ 267,905 $ 37,840 $ 75,680 $ 44,255 $ 110,130 Measurement of fair values A.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective July 1, 2018. Cameco retains full access to this cash . The investments in equity securities represent investments that Cameco intends to hold for the long-term for strategic purposes. As permitted by IFRS 9, these investments have been designated at the date of initial applic ation as measured at FVOCI. The accumulated fair value reserve related to these investments will never be reclassified to profit or loss. Cameco has not irrevocably des ignated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amou nts and fair values of Camecos financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy: As at December 31, 2020 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 45,605 $ - $ 45,605 $ 45,605 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 43,873 43,873 - 43,873 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (4,733) - (4,733) (4,733) Long-term debt [note 13] (995,541) - (1,173,280) (1,173,280) Net $ (910,796) $ 43,873 $ (1,132,408) $ (1,088,535) As at December 31, 2019 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 8,191 $ - $ 8,191 $ 8,191 Interest rate contracts 2,313 - 2,313 2,313 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 24,408 24,408 - 24,408 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (12,524) - (12,524) (12,524) Long-term debt [note 13] (996,718) - (1,111,923) (1,111,923) Net $ (974,330) $ 24,408 $ (1,113,943) $ (1,089,535) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying values of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that are classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments, material investm ents in equity securities and long-term debt at fair value. Investments in publicly held equity securities are classified as a recurring level 1 fair value measurement while derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity securities is determined using quoted share prices observed in the principal market for the securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determine d using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 0.3 % to 1.1 % ( 2019 - 1. 7 % to 1.8 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is me asured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the difference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measurin g the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward interest rate curves. Uranium contract derivatives consist of price swaps. The fair valu e of uranium price swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed purchases or sales under contracted prices, and floating purchases or sales based on Numerco forward uranium price curves. The swaps were settled during 2019. Where applicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company a nd counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date. Derivatives The following table summarizes the fair value of derivatives and classification on the consolidated statements of financial position: 2020 2019 Non-hedge derivatives: Foreign currency contracts $ 40,872 $ (4,333) Interest rate contracts - 2,313 Net $ 40,872 $ (2,020) Classification: Current portion of long-term receivables, investments and other [note 10] $ 16,466 $ 4,144 Long-term receivables, investments and other [note 10] 29,139 6,360 Current portion of other liabilities [note 14] (1,658) (7,505) Other liabilities [note 14] (3,075) (5,019) Net $ 40,872 $ (2,020) The following table summarizes the different components of the gains (losses) on derivatives included in net earnings: 2020 2019 Non-hedge derivatives: Foreign currency contracts $ 30,600 $ 31,863 Interest rate contracts 5,977 2,068 Uranium contracts - (1,662) Net $ 36,577 $ 32,269"

Lease s Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at t he lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any l ease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless th e cost of the right-of-use asset reflect s that the Company will exer cise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be deprec iated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment . The lease liability is measured at amortized co st using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate . Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease pay ments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised . Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exerc ise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized . The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leas es that have a lease term of 12 months or less.

Earnings per share The Company presents basic and d iluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is det ermined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share."

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold s ufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pensio n plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorat ed on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estim ated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company r ecognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by emp loyees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as a n asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

These estimates are reviewed by Cameco technical personnel as required by regulatory agencies or more frequently as circumstances warrant. In connection with future decommissioning and reclamation costs, Cameco has provided financial assurances of $ 1,021,142,000 ( 2019 - $ 994,129 ,000 ) in the form of letters of credit to satisfy current regulatory requirements.

These include contaminated combustible material (paper, rags, gloves, etc.) and contaminated non-combustible material (metal parts, soil from excavations, building and roofing materials, spent uranium concentrate drums, etc.). These materials can in some i nstances be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 8,044 ,000 ( 2019 - $ 8,451,000 ).

Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Re venue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Ca mecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery i s considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to eithe r the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. Whe n uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specif ied quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractua lly obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either ( i ) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where i t instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enri chers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either ( i ) physically del ivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion serv ice provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the custom er at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor component s, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progr ess as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Re venue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in th e contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invo ices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis . Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered ."

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based o n a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and t herefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery . Cameco expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period is less than a year. The following table summarizes Camecos sales disaggregated by geographical region and contract type and includes a reconciliation to the Company s r eportable segments (note 28 ): For the year ended December 31, 2020 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 588,827 $ 206,011 $ 7,676 $ 802,514 Europe 323,565 123,864 3,331 450,760 Asia 499,378 47,421 - 546,799 $ 1,411,770 $ 377,296 $ 11,007 $ 1,800,073 Contract type Fixed-price $ 406,021 $ 355,552 $ 7,686 $ 769,259 Market-related 1,005,749 21,744 3,321 1,030,814 $ 1,411,770 $ 377,296 $ 11,007 $ 1,800,073 For the year ended December 31, 2019 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 569,535 $ 206,226 $ 59,300 $ 835,061 Europe 288,134 79,629 3,587 371,350 Asia 556,140 84,422 15,952 656,514 $ 1,413,809 $ 370,277 $ 78,839 $ 1,862,925 Contract type Fixed-price $ 349,021 $ 305,383 $ 69,703 $ 724,107 Market-related 1,064,788 64,894 9,136 1,138,818 $ 1,413,809 $ 370,277 $ 78,839 $ 1,862,925 Deferred sales The following table provides information about contract liabilities (note 14 ) from contracts with customers: 2020 2019 Beginning of year $ 17,418 $ 30,727 Additions 6,994 9,783 Recognized in revenue (10,026) (23,067) Effect of movements in exchange rates (4) (25) End of year $ 14,382 $ 17,418 Deferred sales primarily relates to advance consideration received from customers for future conversion deliveries and fuel fabrication services as well as revenue related to the storage of uranium and converted uranium held at Cameco facilities. The revenue related to the fuel fabricati on services and storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 20 21 and 20 27. Cameco recognized a reduction of revenue of $ 268,000 ( 2019 - revenue of $ 78,000 ) during 2020 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This is due to the difference between actual pricing indices and the estimates at the time of invoicing. Future sales commitments Cam ecos sales portfolio consists of sho rt and long-term sales commitments. The contracts can be executed well in advance of a delivery and include both fixed and market-related pricing. The following table summarizes the expected future revenue, by segment, related to only fixed-price contracts with remaining future deliveries as follows: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Uranium $ 243,069 $ 189,351 $ 179,212 $ 166,581 $ 129,450 $ 416,947 $ 1,324,610 Fuel services 319,851 272,920 212,655 215,729 216,250 677,611 1,915,016 Other 4,212 - - - - - 4,212 Total $ 567,132 $ 462,271 $ 391,867 $ 382,310 $ 345,700 $ 1,094,558 $ 3,243,838 The sales contracts are denominated largely in US dollars and converted from US to Canadian dollars at a rate of $ 1.30 . The amounts in the table represent the consideration the Company will be entitled to receive when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing. The Company has elected to exclude these amounts from the table as the transaction price will not be known until the time of delivery. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less have been included in the table."

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues a nd expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period a ffected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Further details of the nature of these judgments , estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets whe n there is an indication of possible impairment. If it is determined that carrying values of assets or goodwill cannot be recovered , the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements and mineral reserves. Other assumptions used in t he calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generating units In performing impairment assessme nts of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Management is r equired to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the end of the useful lives of the productive a ssets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs , timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. I ncome taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In calculating income t axes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates deferred income taxes based on temporary diffe rences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabil ities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is de pendent on assumptions and judg ments regarding future market con ditions, production rates and intercompany sales , which can materially impact estimated future taxable income. If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earn ings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on proper ty, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral re serves. Estimates of life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a materia l impact on the amounts of depreciation charged to earnings."

Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value.

Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities , relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby t he Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases."

Non-derivative financial assets Cameco r ecognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are m easured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effor t. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default whe n the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental eff ect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company woul d not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market for a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted fro m the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of re covering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof ."

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 9 , 2021 . B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Companys functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars , unless otherwise noted. A mounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost ba sis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue an d expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods aff ected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5 . This summary of significant accounting policies is a descri ption of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been appli ed consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodw ill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previou sly held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes th e fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value , or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instrument s. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the d ate on which control is acquired b y the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Comp any has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise wher e the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the in itial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includ es transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequent ly reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities , relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby t he Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment t o the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consoli dated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company a nd its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non- monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of f oreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exch ange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole , the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to ear nings as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent s consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are measured at amortized cost . F. Short-term investment s Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are measured at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted product s are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the es timated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the locati on and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an it em of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined b y comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depr eciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as sub stantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset ente rs the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount o f the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired . At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the ec onomic benefits of the business combination . Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently a t cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite us eful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Lease s Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at t he lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any l ease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless th e cost of the right-of-use asset reflect s that the Company will exer cise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be deprec iated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment . The lease liability is measured at amortized co st using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate . Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease pay ments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised . Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exerc ise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized . The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leas es that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term . K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on f unds invested . Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue , using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and costs incurred on redemp tion of debentures . Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged agains t earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i . Non-derivative financial assets Cameco r ecognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are m easured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effor t. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default whe n the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental eff ect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company woul d not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market for a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted fro m the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of re covering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof . ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such i ndication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration p roperties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the C ompany in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exp loration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of c onfidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized u nder the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or construc tive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost . i . Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, r eclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence condit ions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates a re involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the recla mation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provi sion resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i . Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold s ufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pensio n plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorat ed on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estim ated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company r ecognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by emp loyees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as a n asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usua lly conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defin ed benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term em ployee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or const ructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the no rmal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant dat e fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recogni zed as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related servi ce and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditio nally become entitled to payment. The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equit y-set tled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the mod ified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not ad justed if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value . Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Re venue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Ca mecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery i s considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to eithe r the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. Whe n uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specif ied quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractua lly obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either ( i ) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where i t instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enri chers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either ( i ) physically del ivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion serv ice provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the custom er at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor component s, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progr ess as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Re venue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in th e contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invo ices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis . Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered . R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another . Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable wit hout a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price . i . Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for m anaging its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not de signated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and loss es and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is he ld within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the pri ncipal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses a re re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to presen t subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly re presents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FV TPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be dere cognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is design ated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized co st using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged o r cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recogni zed at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Der ivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separatel y if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. D erivative fi nancial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transact ion costs recog nized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss . The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or mo re risks by creating an offset between changes in t he fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow he dge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2020 and 2019 . S. Income tax Income tax expense is c omprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expe cted tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measu red at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used fo r taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred ta x asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is proba ble that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each repor ting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materia lize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and d iluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is det ermined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classifie d as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team . Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill. W. Government assistance Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance tha t the Company has complied with the relevant conditions of the grant and that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses have been recognized ."

Segmented information Cameco has two reportable segments: uranium and fuel services. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies . The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium concentrate. The fuel ser vices segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services. Cost of sales in the uranium segment includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that currently have produc tion suspensions. Cameco expensed $ 195,972 ,000 ( 2019 - $ 153,924 ,000 ) of care and maintenance c osts during the year . Included in th is amount in 2020 is $ 45 , 988 ,000 relating to care and maintenance costs for operations suspended as a result of COVID-19 . Also included in cost of sales , because of the Cigar Lake production suspension, is the impact of increased purchasing activity at a higher cost than produced pounds . This had a negative impact on gross profit in the uranium segment. Cost of sales in the fuel services segment also includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that have had production suspensions as a result of COVID-19. Cameco expensed $ 8,992,000 in 2020 due to the suspension. Accounting policies used in ea ch segment are consistent with the policies outlined in the summary of significant accounting policies. Segment revenues, expenses and results include transactions between segments incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Income tax Income tax expense is c omprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expe cted tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measu red at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used fo r taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred ta x asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is proba ble that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each repor ting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materia lize."

B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board.

The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period is based on Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets a nd whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . Prior to 2020, total shareholder return over three years was also a vesting condition. If the participant elects a cash payout, the redemption am ount will be based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Camecos common shares on March 1 or, if March 1 is not a trading day, on the first trading day following March 1. As of December 31, 2020 , the total number of PSUs held by the participa nts, after adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,720,636 ( 2019 - 1, 465 , 618 ). C . Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by t he board. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. These same participants, if they have met or are not subject to share ownership requirements, may elect to have their award paid as a lump sum cash amount . During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2020 , the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 927,462, ( 2019 - 4 43,274 ). D. Phantom stock option Cameco makes annual gra nts of bonuses to eligible non-North American employees in the form of phantom stock options. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the clos ing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2020 , the number of optio ns held by participating employees was 422,291 ( 2019 - 406,270 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.32 to $ 2 6 .81 per share ( 2019 - $ 11.32 to $ 26.81 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 15.66 ( 2019 - $ 16.48 ). E. Employee share ownership p lan Cameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contribution. Under the plan, em ployees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each employee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2020 , there were 2,257 participants in the plan ( 2019 - 2,2 53 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2020 with Company contributions was 248,837 ( 2019 - 235,915 ). In 2020 , the Companys contributions totaled $ 3,174,000 ( 2019 - $ 3,127,000 ). F. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to n on-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with the balan ce, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be redeemed for cas h upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs he ld by the director. As of December 31, 2020 , the total number of DSUs held by participating directors was 541,827 ( 2019 - 474,266 ). Equity-settled plans Cameco records compensation expense under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed surplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2020 2019 Stock option plan $ 1,011 $ 4,418 Performance share unit plan (a) 2,650 7,245 Restricted share unit plan 2,903 2,679 Employee share ownership plan 3,174 3,127 Total $ 9,738 $ 17,469 (a) In the fourth quarter of 2019, the performance share unit plan was amended to allow eligible participants to elect payout of their grants in cash or shares, provided they have met their share ownership requirements. As a result, this plan is now considered cash-settled for new grants . Expenses related to PSUs granted in previous years will continue to appear as equity-settled if certain assumptions related to the calculation of fair value are met . Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans T he fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled RSU plan were as follows: Grant date Mar 1/20 Number of options granted 283,426 Average strike price $11.45 Expected forfeitures 13% Weighted average grant date fair values $11.45 Cash -settled plans Cameco has recognized the following expenses (recoveries) under its cash-settled plans: 2020 2019 Deferred share unit plan $ 3,765 $ (1,001) Performance share unit plan 20,287 - Phantom stock option plan 1,340 (436) Restricted share unit plan (a) 1,849 - Total $ 27,241 $ (1,437) (a) Due to the inclusion of a new group of participants in the RSU plan that are able to elect cash settlement, grants to this group will appear as an expense of a cash-settled plan. Grants to the original group of participants are still disclosed as an expens e of an equity-settled plan . At December 31, 2020 , a liability of $ 38 , 354 ,000 ( 2019 - $ 14,577,000 ) was included in the consolidated statements of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurem ent of cash-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and the fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. The phantom stock optio n plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plan s at the grant and reporting dates were as follows: PSU RSU Phantom stock options Grant date Reporting date Grant date Reporting date Grant date Reporting date Mar 1/20 Dec 31/20 Mar 1/20 Dec 31/20 Mar 1/20 Dec 31/20 Number of units 636,570 1,720,636 423,180 425,176 112,140 422,291 Expected vesting 102% 129% - - - - Average strike price - - - - $11.61 $15.66 Expected dividend - - - - $0.08 $0.08 Expected volatility (a) - 22% - - 39% 41% Risk-free interest rate (a) - 0.1% - - 0.6% 0.3% Expected life of option 3.0 years 1 year 3.0 years 2.2 years 4 years 3.4 years Expected forfeitures 12% 11% 12% 12% 8% 7% Weighted average measurement date fair values $11.45 $22.01 $11.45 $17.05 $2.85 $5.43 (a) During the first quarter of 2020, the vesting conditions of the PSU plan were amended such that total shareholder return is no longer included for new grants. Due to this change, expected volatility and the risk-free interest rate will no longer be considered in calculating the fair value of new grants. In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The non-market criteria relating to realized selling prices and operating targets hav e been incorporated into the valuation at both grant and reporting date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such i ndication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration p roperties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments."

Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate."

Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2021 and 2020. S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share."

Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable.

Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize."

Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives.

Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term."

Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site.

Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met."

Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered. R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another. Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. i. Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition."

Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services.

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings."

Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows:"

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Further details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets when there is an indication of possible impairment. If it is determined that carrying values of assets or goodwill cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements and mineral reserves. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generating units In performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the end of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs, timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. Income taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In calculating income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on assumptions and judgments regarding future market conditions, production rates and intercompany sales, which can materially impact estimated future taxable income. If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earnings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates of life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amounts of depreciation charged to earnings."

In conjunction with the issuance of the Series H debentures, on November 20, 2020, the $ 400,000,000 principal amount of the Series E debentures was redeemed. Cameco recognized $ 24,439,000 of finance costs in relation to the early redemption of these debentures (note 19). Cameco has a $ 1,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that is available until October 1, 2025 .

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental executive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP), Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced benefits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered base plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets currently held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cameco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to eligible employees and their dependents. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for the Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1,505,000 in contributions and letter of credit fees to its defined benefit plans in 2022. The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expose Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective date of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2021. The next planned effective date for valuations is January 1, 2024. Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis that these plans are not exposed to materially different risks.

A 1 % change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (9,593) $ 12,380 $ (3,003) $ 3,769 Rate of compensation increase 1,024 (984) n/a n/a A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Camecos plans as at December 31, 2021. The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with the methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 2,032,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the defined benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Segmented information Cameco has two reportable segments: uranium and fuel services. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies. The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium concentrate. The fuel services segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services. During the year, Cameco determined that NUKEM no longer meets the criteria for being considered a segment and concluded that it was appropriate to include NUKEMs results with its uranium and fuel services segments. NUKEMs purchase and sale of uranium concentrate and conversion services are now being reported internally as part of its uranium and fuel services businesses and should therefore be included with those businesses for segment reporting. The purchase and sale of enriched uranium product and separative work units will continue to be reported in other. Comparative information has been adjusted. Cost of sales in the uranium segment includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that have had production suspensions. Cameco expensed $ 209,556,000 (2020 - $ 195,972,000 ) of care and maintenance costs during the year. Included in this amount in 2021 is $ 40,359,000 (2020 - $ 45,988,000 ) relating to care and maintenance costs for operations suspended as a result of COVID-19. Also included in cost of sales, because of the Cigar Lake production suspension, is the impact of increased purchasing activity at a higher cost than produced pounds. Cost of sales in the fuel services segment also includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that have had production suspensions as a result of COVID-19. Cameco expensed $ 8,992,000 in 2020 due to the suspension. Accounting policies used in each segment are consistent with the policies outlined in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Major customers Cameco relies on a small number of customers to purchase a significant portion of its uranium concentrates and uranium conversion services. During 2021, revenues from two customers of Camecos uranium and fuel services segments represented approximately $ 166,068,000 (2020 - $ 457,560,000 ), approximately 11 % (2020 - 25 %) of Camecos total revenues from these segments. As customers are relatively few in number, accounts receivable from any individual customer may periodically exceed 10% of accounts receivable depending on delivery schedule."

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes for assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data when available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not have any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 24 - Share-based compensation plans Note 26 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow denominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity contracts change. The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Companys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and retention of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates and pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects financial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cameco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a price for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuations because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign exchange risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 28,006 $ 1,400 Accounts receivable USD 226,153 11,308 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (152,412) (7,620) Net foreign currency derivatives USD 27,774 (45,177) A 5 % strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2021 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved policy limits. At December 31, 2021, the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 92 % (2020 - 100 %). Cameco was exposed to interest rate risk during the year through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 75,000,000 of the Series H senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. Under the terms of the swap, Cameco makes interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.3 % and receives fixed interest payments of 2.95 %. In addition, the Series E senior unsecured debentures that were retired on November 16, 2020 were also subject to interest rate swap contracts. A notional amount of $ 150,000,000 of the Series E senior unsecured debentures had been swapped for variable rate payments. Under the terms of these swaps, Cameco made interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.2 % and received fixed interest payments of 3.75 %. At the time of the termination of the Series E swaps, the fair value of the interest rate swap net asset was $ 7,330,000 . At December 31, 2021, the fair value of Camecos interest rate swap net asset was $ 673,000 (2020 - $nil). Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,247,447 $ 918,382 Short-term investments 84,906 24,985 Accounts receivable [note 6] 272,220 166,788 Derivative assets [note 10] 32,098 45,605 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 1,247,000,000 at December 31, 2021 (2020 - $ 918,000,000 ). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non- payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the credit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre- payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 259,683 Non-investment grade credit rating 11,332 Total gross carrying amount $ 271,015 Loss allowance - Net $ 271,015 At December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has not experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward- looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Camecos aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2021: Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 269,474 $ 423 269,897 1-30 days past due 334 62 396 More than 30 days past due 58 664 722 Total $ 269,866 $ 1,149 271,015 Liquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. The table below outlines the Companys available debt facilities at December 31, 2021: Outstanding and Total amount committed Amount available Unsecured revolving credit facility [note 13] $ 1,000,000 $ - $ 1,000,000 Letter of credit facilities [note 13] 1,696,041 1,573,873 122,168 The tables below present a maturity analysis of Camecos financial liabilities, including principal and interest, based on the expected cash flows from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date: Due in Carrying Contractual less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 amount cash flows 1 year years years years Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 340,458 $ 340,458 $ 340,458 $ - $ - $ - Long-term debt 996,250 1,000,000 - 500,000 - 500,000 Foreign currency contracts 3,760 3,760 378 3,382 - - Interest rate contracts 1,237 1,237 - 585 490 162 Lease obligation [note 14] 4,872 5,174 2,736 2,381 57 - Total contractual repayments $ 1,346,577 $ 1,350,629 $ 343,572 $ 506,348 $ 547 $ 500,162 Due in less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 Total 1 year years years years Total interest payments on long-term debt $ 230,065 $ 37,840 $ 65,205 $ 33,780 $ 93,240 Measurement of fair values A.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective July 1, 2018. Cameco retains full access to this cash. During the year, Cameco divested of its investments in equity securities. The fair value at the date of derecognition and the cumulative gain or loss on disposal for the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows: Fair Value Gain (loss) Investment in Denison Mines Corp. $ 34,827 $ 15,257 Investment in UEX Corporation 19,605 8,758 Investment in ISO Energy Ltd. 10,756 8,078 Investment in GoviEx 3,558 2,996 Other 265 (750) $ 69,011 $ 34,339 The gains are presented net of tax. Cameco has elected to transfer these cumulative net gains from equity investments at FVOCI to retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity. Cameco has not irrevocably designated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of Camecos financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy: As at December 31, 2021 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 31,534 $ - $ 31,534 $ 31,534 Interest rate contracts 564 - 564 564 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (3,760) - (3,760) (3,760) Interest rate contracts (1,237) - (1,237) (1,237) Long-term debt [note 13] (996,250) - (1,103,978) (1,103,978) Net $ (969,149) $ - $ (1,076,877) $ (1,076,877) As at December 31, 2020 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 45,605 $ - $ 45,605 $ 45,605 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 43,873 43,873 - 43,873 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (4,733) - (4,733) (4,733) Long-term debt [note 13] (995,541) - (1,173,280) (1,173,280) Net $ (910,796) $ 43,873 $ (1,132,408) $ (1,088,535) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying values of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that are classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments, material investments in equity securities and long-term debt at fair value. Investments in publicly held equity securities are classified as a recurring level 1 fair value measurement while derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity securities is determined using quoted share prices observed in the principal market for the securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 1.1 % to 1.7 % (2020 - 0.3 % to 1.1 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the difference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward interest rate curves. Where applicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date.

The realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions during the periods in which the Companys deferred tax assets are available. The Company considers whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are available, realization of these deferred tax assets is probable and consequently the deferred tax assets have been recorded.

Reassessments Canada On February 18, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada (Supreme Court) dismissed Canada Revenue Agencys (CRA) application for leave to appeal the June 26, 2020 decision of the Federal Court of Appeal (Court of Appeal). The dismissal means that the dispute for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years is fully and finally resolved in the Companys favour. In September 2018, the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) ruled that the marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, as well as the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium sales and purchasing agreements, were in full compliance with Canadian law for the tax years in question. Management believes the principles in the decision apply to all subsequent tax years, and that the ultimate resolution of those years will not be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution. The total tax reassessed for the three tax years was $ 11,000,000 , and Cameco remitted 50 %. Cameco has received refunds totaling about $ 5,500,000 plus interest. In addition, on April 30, 2019, the Tax Court awarded Cameco $ 10,300,000 for legal fees incurred, plus an amount for disbursements of up to $ 16,700,000 . The amount of the award was recognized as a reduction of administration expense in the first quarter of 2021. If CRA continues to pursue reassessments for tax years subsequent to 2006, Cameco will continue to utilize its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules. G. Income tax losses At December 31, 2021, income tax losses carried forward of $ 2,177,025,000 (2020 - $ 2,399,647,000 ) are available to reduce taxable income.

A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation.

A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings.

Cameco Corporation Cameco Corporation is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The address of its registered office is 2121 11th Street West, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7M 1J3. The consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021 comprise Cameco Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or Cameco) and the Companys interests in associates and joint arrangements. Cameco is one of the worlds largest providers of the uranium needed to generate clean, reliable baseload electricity around the globe. The Company has mines in northern Saskatchewan and the United States, as well as a 40% interest in Joint Venture Inkai LLP (JV Inkai), a joint arrangement with Joint Stock Company National Atomic Company Kazatomprom (Kazatomprom), located in Kazakhstan. JV Inkai is accounted for on an equity basis (see note 11). Camecos Cigar Lake mine was placed in a temporary state of care and maintenance in March of 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. While production resumed in September, the mine returned to a temporary state of care and maintenance in January 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Production once again resumed in April 2021. Cameco also has two other operations in northern Saskatchewan which are in care and maintenance. Rabbit Lake was placed in care and maintenance in the second quarter of 2016 while operations at McArthur River/Key Lake were suspended indefinitely in the third quarter of 2018. Camecos operations in the United States, Crow Butte and Smith Ranch-Highland, are also not currently producing as the decision was made in 2016 to curtail production and defer all wellfield development. See note 28 for the financial statement impact. The Company is also a leading provider of nuclear fuel processing services, supplying much of the worlds reactor fleet with the fuel to generate one of the cleanest sources of electricity available today. It operates the worlds largest commercial refinery in Blind River, Ontario, controls a significant portion of the world UF 6 primary conversion capacity in Port Hope, Ontario and is a leading manufacturer of fuel assemblies and reactor components for CANDU reactors at facilities in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario. Also a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, production was temporarily suspended at the Port Hope UF 6 conversion plant and at the Blind River refinery for approximately four weeks in the second quarter of 2020.

Despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy, Camecos approach to capital management has remained consistent. Camecos capital structure reflects its strategy and the environment in which it operates. Delivering returns to long- term shareholders is a top priority. The Companys objective is to maximize cash flow while maintaining its investment grade rating through close capital management of our balance sheet metrics. Capital resources are managed to allow it to support achievement of its goals while managing financial risks such as the continued weakness in the market, litigation risk and refinancing risk. The overall objectives for managing capital in 2021 reflect the environment that the Company is operating in, similar to the prior comparative period.

Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future decommissioning and reclamation costs for its existing operating assets to be $ 1,100,378,000 (2020 - $ 1,130,495,000 ). The expected timing of these outflows is based on life-of-mine plans with the majority of expenditures expected to occur after 2027 .

These materials can in some instances be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 8,169,000 (2020 - $ 8,044,000 ). The majority of these expenditures are expected to occur within the next four years."

Related parties A. Transactions with key management personnel Key management personnel are those persons that have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company, directly or indirectly. Key management personnel of the Company include executive officers, vice-presidents, other senior managers and members of the board of directors. In addition to their salaries, Cameco also provides non-cash benefits to executive officers and vice-presidents and contributes to pension plans on their behalf (note 25). Senior management and directors also participate in the Companys share-based compensation plans (note 24). Executive officers are subject to terms of notice ranging from three to six months. Upon resignation at the Companys request, they are entitled to termination benefits of up to the lesser of 18 to 24 months or the period remaining until age 65. The termination benefits include gross salary plus the target short-term incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs.

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based on a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and therefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery. Cameco expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period is less than a year. The following table summarizes Camecos sales disaggregated by geographical region and contract type and includes a reconciliation to the Companys reportable segments (note 28): For the year ended December 31, 2021 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 547,257 $ 287,802 $ 12,769 $ 847,828 Europe 218,879 77,110 2,945 298,934 Asia 288,857 39,365 - 328,222 $ 1,054,993 $ 404,277 $ 15,714 $ 1,474,984 Contract type Fixed-price $ 307,858 $ 384,065 $ 11,421 $ 703,344 Market-related 747,135 20,212 4,293 771,640 $ 1,054,993 $ 404,277 $ 15,714 $ 1,474,984 For the year ended December 31, 2020 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 593,182 $ 206,011 $ 3,321 $ 802,514 Europe 323,565 123,864 3,331 450,760 Asia 499,378 47,421 - 546,799 $ 1,416,125 $ 377,296 $ 6,652 $ 1,800,073 Contract type Fixed-price $ 410,376 $ 355,552 $ 3,331 $ 769,259 Market-related 1,005,749 21,744 3,321 1,030,814 $ 1,416,125 $ 377,296 $ 6,652 $ 1,800,073 Deferred sales The following table provides information about contract liabilities (note 14) from contracts with customers: 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 14,382 $ 17,418 Additions 16,531 6,994 Recognized in revenue (7,596) (10,026) Effect of movements in exchange rates (1) (4) End of year $ 23,316 $ 14,382 Deferred sales primarily relates to advance consideration received from customers for future conversion deliveries and fuel fabrication services as well as revenue related to the storage of uranium and converted uranium held at Cameco facilities. The revenue related to the fuel fabrication services and storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 2024 and 2030. Cameco recognized an increase of revenue of $ 383,000 (2020 - reduction of revenue of $ 268,000 ) during 2021 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This is due to the difference between actual pricing indices and the estimates at the time of invoicing. Future sales commitments Camecos sales portfolio consists of short and long-term sales commitments. The contracts can be executed well in advance of a delivery and include both fixed and market-related pricing. The following table summarizes the expected future revenue, by segment, related to only fixed-price contracts with remaining future deliveries as follows: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Uranium $ 298,355 $ 273,739 $ 332,247 $ 219,546 $ 108,004 $ 527,366 $ 1,759,257 Fuel services 298,232 248,395 269,227 241,940 181,707 560,458 1,799,959 Total $ 596,587 $ 522,134 $ 601,474 $ 461,486 $ 289,711 $ 1,087,824 $ 3,559,216 The sales contracts are denominated largely in US dollars and converted from US to Canadian dollars at a rate of $ 1.27 . The amounts in the table represent the consideration the Company will be entitled to receive when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing. The Company has elected to exclude these amounts from the table as the transaction price will not be known until the time of delivery. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less have been included in the table."

Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2021 2020 Beginning of year 6,158,539 8,617,097 Options granted - - Options forfeited (18,005) (81,991) Options expired (886,009) (1,911,558) Options exercised [note 16] (1,796,524) (465,009) End of year 3,458,001 6,158,539 Exercisable 3,162,415 5,076,226 Weighted average share prices were as follows: 2021 2020 Beginning of year $16.98 $17.44 Options granted - - Options forfeited 26.08 22.22 Options expired 22.05 20.14 Options exercised 14.90 11.56 End of year $16.72 $16.98 Exercisable $16.85 $17.73 The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise during 2021 was $ 22.09 per share (2020 - $ 14.58 ). Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2021 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $ 11.32 - 15.83 1,833,572 4.2 $14.56 1,537,986 $14.43 $ 15.84 - 26.81 1,624,429 1.5 $19.15 1,624,429 $19.15 3,458,001 3,162,415 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from March 2, 2022 to February 28, 2027. B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the participants discretion (prior to the fourth quarter of 2019 it was at the boards discretion) provided they have met their ownership requirements, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period is based on Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . Prior to 2020, total shareholder return over three years was also a vesting condition. If the participant elects a cash payout, the redemption amount will be based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Camecos common shares on March 1 or, if March 1 is not a trading day, on the first trading day following March 1. As of December 31, 2021, the total number of PSUs held by the participants, after adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,495,709 (2020 - 1,720,636 ). C. Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. These same participants, if they have met or are not subject to share ownership requirements, may elect to have their award paid as a lump sum cash amount. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2021, the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 1,081,783 (2020 - 927,462 ). D. Phantom stock option The Company has established a phantom stock option plan for eligible non-North American employees. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2021, the number of options held by participating employees was 173,835 (2020 - 422,291 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.32 to $ 26.81 per share (2020 - $ 11.32 to $ 26.81 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 13.88 (2020 - $ 15.66 ). E. Phantom restricted share unit (PRSU) During the year, the Company established a PRSU plan whereby it provides non-North American employees an annual grant of PRSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PRSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of cash with an equivalent market value. The PRSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2021, the total number of PRSUs held by the participants was 16,027 . F. Employee share ownership plan Cameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contribution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each employee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2021, there were 2,301 participants in the plan (2020 - 2,257 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2021 with Company contributions was 149,822 (2020 - 248,837 ). In 2021, the Companys contributions totaled $ 3,301,000 (2020 - $ 3,174,000 ). G. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with the balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be redeemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the director. As of December 31, 2021, the total number of DSUs held by participating directors was 579,362 (2020 - 541,827 ). Equity-settled plans Cameco records compensation expense under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed surplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2021 2020 Employee share ownership plan $ 3,301 $ 3,174 Restricted share unit plan 2,933 2,903 Performance share unit plan 1,237 2,650 Stock option plan 366 1,011 Total $ 7,837 $ 9,738 Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled RSU plan were as follows: Grant date Mar 1/21 Number of options granted 168,496 Average strike price $20.25 Expected forfeitures 11% Weighted average grant date fair values $20.25 Cash-settled plans Cameco has recognized the following expenses under its cash-settled plans: 2021 2020 Performance share unit plan $ 25,784 $ 20,287 Restricted share unit plan 6,890 1,849 Deferred share unit plan 6,741 3,765 Phantom stock option plan 2,261 1,340 Phantom restricted share unit plan 163 - Total $ 41,839 $ 27,241 At December 31, 2021, a liability of $ 61,030,000 (2020 - $ 38,354,000 ) was included in the consolidated statement of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and projections of the non-market criteria. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. The phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the March 1, 2021 grant date were as follows: Phantom PSU RSU RSU Number of units 369,110 245,530 15,980 Expected vesting 72% - - Expected dividend - - $0.08 Expected life of option 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected forfeitures 10% 10% 7% Weighted average measurement date fair values $14.56 $20.25 $20.25 The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the reporting date were as follows: Phantom Phantom stock options PSU RSU RSU Number of units 173,835 1,495,709 672,675 16,027 Expected vesting - 114% - - Average strike price $13.88 - - - Expected dividend $0.08 - - $0.08 Expected volatility 50% - - - Risk-free interest rate 1.0% - - - Expected life of option 2 years 0.9 years 1.5 years 2.2 years Expected forfeitures 7% 3% 10% 7% Weighted average measurement date fair values $15.14 $31.44 $27.58 $27.58 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The non- market criteria relating to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at both grant and reporting date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets."

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 8, 2022. B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Companys functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. Amounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5. This summary of significant accounting policies is a description of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole, the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are measured at amortized cost. F. Short-term investments Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are measured at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset enters the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the economic benefits of the business combination. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and costs incurred on redemption of debentures. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i. Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost. i. Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered. R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another. Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. i. Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2021 and 2020. S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill. W. Government assistance Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company has complied with the relevant conditions of the grant and that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses have been recognized."

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments."

Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate."

Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation.

Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period.

Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment."

Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize."

Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate."

Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized."

Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term."

Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity)."

Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss."

Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products, except in limited circumstances. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered."

Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased."

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Further details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets and investments Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments in associates and joint ventures when there is an indication of possible impairment. If it is determined that carrying values of assets cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements, mineral reserves and the impact of geopolitical events. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generating units In performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the end of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs, timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. Income taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In calculating income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on assumptions and judgments regarding future market conditions and production rates, which can materially impact estimated future taxable income. If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earnings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates of life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amounts of depreciation charged to earnings."

Acquisition of additional interest in Cigar Lake Joint Venture (CLJV) On May 19, 2022, Cameco and Orano Canada Inc. (Orano) completed the acquisition of Idemitsu Canada Resources Ltd.s (Idemitsu) 7.875 % participating interest in the CLJV by acquiring their pro rata shares through an asset purchase. Camecos ownership stake in the Cigar Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan is now 54.547 % (previously 50.025 %). The primary reason for the business combination was to increase our ownership interest. Cash consideration of $ 101,681,000 was paid for the additional 4.522 % interest. At December 31, 2022, $ 3,000,000 remained in escrow, to be paid upon finalization of closing adjustments. While Cameco received the economic benefit of owning the additional interest as of January 1, 2022, the additional interest has been proportionately consolidated with the results of Cameco commencing on May 19, 2022. CLJV allocates uranium production to each joint operation participant and the joint operation participant derives revenue directly from the sale of such product. Mining and milling expenses incurred by joint operations are included in the cost of inventory. As such, there is no revenue or profit or loss of the acquiree included in the consolidated statements of earnings. If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the year, Camecos share of production would have included an additional 296,000 pounds. The impact to the financial statements would not have been material. Acquisition costs of $ 1,495,000 have been included in administration expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022. Included in the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition are inputs, production processes and outputs. Therefore, Cameco has determined that together the acquired set is a business. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and quoted market prices. The values assigned to the net assets acquired were as follows: Property, plant and equipment $ 97,930 Deferred tax asset (a) 28,196 Inventory 9,909 Working capital (24) Reclamation provision (2,528) Sales contracts (9,000) Net assts acquired $ 124,483 Cash paid 101,681 Bargain purchase gain (b) $ 22,802 (a) The deferred tax asset has been measured provisionally, pending further review of the income tax attributes of the acquisition. (b) The preliminary bargain purchase gain resulted from applying the measurement requirements under IFRS 3, Business Combinations . This standard requires the measurement of tax attributes that were acquired as part of the transaction be in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes , rather than at fair value. The measured amount of these attributes exceeded the amount paid for them and the resulting gain is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of earnings. The accounting for the acquisition will be revised if, within one year of the acquisition date, new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition. Revision will occur if this new information identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition."

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental executive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP), Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced benefits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered base plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets currently held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cameco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to eligible employees and their dependents. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for the Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1,675,000 in contributions and letter of credit fees to its defined benefit plans in 2023. The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expose Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective date of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2021. The next planned effective date for valuations is January 1, 2024. Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis that these plans are not exposed to materially different risks. Information relating to Camecos defined benefit plans is shown in the following table: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 5,693 $ 6,217 $ - $ - Interest income on plan assets 157 144 - - Return on assets excluding interest income (555) 172 - - Employer contributions - 67 - - Benefits paid (890) (903) - - Administrative costs paid (3) (4) - - Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 4,402 $ 5,693 $ - $ - Defined benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 69,998 $ 72,119 $ 24,697 $ 25,827 Current service cost 2,302 2,332 915 956 Interest cost 1,867 1,550 726 652 Actuarial loss (gain) arising from: - financial assumptions (20,913) (1,996) (5,881) (1,403) - experience adjustment 1,396 (903) 161 (697) Benefits paid (3,666) (1,741) (1,254) (638) Foreign exchange 234 (1,363) - - Defined benefit obligation, end of year $ 51,218 $ 69,998 $ 19,364 $ 24,697 Defined benefit liability [note 15] $ (46,816) $ (64,305) $ (19,364) $ (24,697) The percentages of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset category at December 31 were as follows: Pension benefit plans 2022 2021 Asset category (a) Canadian equity securities 6% 8% U.S. equity securities 11% 13% Global equity securities 6% 8% Canadian fixed income 28% 32% Other (b) 49% 39% Total 100% 100% (a) The defined benefit plan assets contain no material amounts of related party assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. (b) Relates mainly to the value of the refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency. The refundable total is approximately equal to half of the sum of the realized investment income plus employer contributions less half of the benefits paid by the plan .

A 1 % change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (6,148) $ 7,737 $ (2,366) $ 2,975 A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Camecos plans as at December 31, 2022. The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with the methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 1,236,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the defined benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Segmented information Cameco has two reportable segments: uranium and fuel services. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies. The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium concentrate. The fuel services segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services. Cost of sales in the uranium segment includes care and maintenance costs for our operations that have had production suspensions as well as operational readiness costs for our operations that are resuming operations. Operational readiness costs include costs to complete critical projects, perform maintenance readiness checks, and recruit and train sufficient mine and mill personnel before beginning operations. Cameco expensed $ 218,439,000 of care and maintenance and operational readiness costs during the year (2021 - $ 209,556,000 of care and maintenance costs). Included in this amount in 2021 is $ 40,359,000 relating to care and maintenance costs for operations suspended as a result of COVID-19 and the related impact of increased purchasing activity at a higher cost than produced pounds. This had a negative impact on gross profit in the uranium segment. Accounting policies used in each segment are consistent with the policies outlined in the summary of significant accounting policies. A.

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes for assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data when available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not have any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 6 - Acquisition of additional interest in Cigar Lake Joint Venture (CLJV) Note 25 - Share-based compensation plans Note 27 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow denominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency and interest rate contracts change. The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Companys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and retention of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates and pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects financial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cameco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a price for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuations because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign exchange risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 414,683 $ 20,734 Short-term investments USD 886,020 44,301 Accounts receivable USD 136,246 6,812 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (176,746) (8,837) Net foreign currency derivatives USD (48,251) (71,836) A 5 % strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2022 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved policy limits. At December 31, 2022, the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 92 % (2021 - 92 %). Cameco was exposed to interest rate risk during the year through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 75,000,000 of the Series H senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. Under the terms of the swap, Cameco makes interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.3 % and receives fixed interest payments of 2.95 %. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of Camecos interest rate swap net liability was $ 7,284,000 (2021 - $ 673,000 ). Cameco measures its exposure to interest rate risk as the change in cash flows that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in interest rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined the impact on earnings of a 1 % increase in interest rate on its interest rate contracts to be a loss of $ 766,000 . Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,143,674 $ 1,247,447 Short-term investments 1,138,174 84,906 Accounts receivable [note 7] 178,088 272,220 Derivative assets [note 11] 2,807 32,098 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 1,143,674,000 at December 31, 2022 (2021 - $ 1,247,447,000 ). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Short-term investments Cameco held short-term investments of $ 1,138,174,000 at December 31, 2022 (2021 - $ 84,906,000 ). The Company mitigates its credit risk by requiring that the issuer/guarantor of the investment have a minimum short-term credit rating and/or a long- term debt rating at the time of purchase, according to the investment credit ratings as issued by DBRS or S&amp;P, or the equivalent of the DBRS or S&amp;P rating at another reputable rating agency. In addition to the credit-rating requirement, Cameco also mitigates risk by prescribing limits by counterparty and types of investment products. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk related to short-term investments by applying historic default rates to outstanding investment balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non- payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the credit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre- payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 139,708 Non-investment grade credit rating 27,980 Total gross carrying amount $ 167,688 Loss allowance - Net $ 167,688 At December 31, 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has not experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward- looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Camecos aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2022: Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 166,361 $ 398 166,759 1-30 days past due 639 171 810 More than 30 days past due 99 20 119 Total $ 167,099 $ 589 167,688 Liquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. The table below outlines the Companys available debt facilities at December 31, 2022: Outstanding and Total amount committed Amount available Unsecured revolving credit facility [note 14] $ 1,000,000 $ - $ 1,000,000 Letter of credit facilities [note 14] 1,756,754 1,593,379 163,375 The tables below present a maturity analysis of Camecos financial liabilities, including principal and interest, based on the expected cash flows from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date: Due in Carrying Contractual less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 amount cash flows 1 year years years years Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 374,714 $ 374,714 $ 374,714 $ - $ - $ - Long-term debt 997,000 1,000,000 - 500,000 400,000 100,000 Foreign currency contracts 51,058 51,058 23,476 27,582 - - Interest rate contracts 7,284 7,284 2,437 2,987 1,860 - Lease obligation [note 15] 9,287 10,314 2,681 2,595 1,718 3,320 Total contractual repayments $ 1,439,343 $ 1,443,370 $ 403,308 $ 533,164 $ 403,578 $ 103,320 Due in less than Due in 1-3 Due in 3-5 Due after 5 Total 1 year years years years Total interest payments on long-term debt $ 192,225 $ 37,840 $ 44,255 $ 33,780 $ 76,350 Measurement of fair values A.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective July 1, 2018. Cameco retains full access to this cash. Cameco has issued guarantees to certain banks in respect of the credit facilities granted to various subsidiaries. These facilities consist of daily overdraft limits and credit lines. At December 31, 2022 the Company has issued guarantees of up to $ 179,700,000 ($ 132,600,000 (US)), which is the maximum amount the Company could be exposed to at any point in time. During 2021, Cameco divested of its investments in equity securities. The fair value at the date of derecognition and the cumulative gain or loss on disposal for the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows: Fair Value Gain (loss) Investment in Denison Mines Corp. $ 34,827 $ 15,257 Investment in UEX Corporation 19,605 8,758 Investment in ISO Energy Ltd. 10,756 8,078 Investment in GoviEx 3,558 2,996 Other 265 (750) $ 69,011 $ 34,339 The gains were presented net of tax. Cameco elected to transfer these cumulative net gains from equity investments at FVOCI to retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity. Cameco has not irrevocably designated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and level 2 fair value measurements of Camecos financial instruments: As at December 31, 2022 Carrying value Fair value Derivative assets [note 11] Foreign currency contracts $ 2,807 $ 2,807 Derivative liabilities [note 15] Foreign currency contracts (51,058) (51,058) Interest rate contracts (7,284) (7,284) Long-term debt [note 14] (997,000) (1,014,010) Net $ (1,052,535) $ (1,069,545) As at December 31, 2021 Carrying value Fair value Derivative assets [note 11] Foreign currency contracts $ 31,534 $ 31,534 Interest rate contracts 564 564 Derivative liabilities [note 15] Foreign currency contracts (3,760) (3,760) Interest rate contracts (1,237) (1,237) Long-term debt [note 14] (996,250) (1,103,978) Net $ (969,149) $ (1,076,877) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying values of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that are classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments and long-term debt at fair value. Derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 3.3 % to 4.2 % (2021 - 1.1 % to 1.7 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the difference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward interest rate curves. Where applicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date.

The realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions during the periods in which the Companys deferred tax assets are available. The Company considers whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are available, realization of these deferred tax assets is probable and consequently the deferred tax assets have been recorded.

Reassessments Canada On February 18, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada (Supreme Court) dismissed Canada Revenue Agencys (CRA) application for leave to appeal the June 26, 2020 decision of the Federal Court of Appeal (Court of Appeal). The dismissal means that the dispute for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years is fully and finally resolved in the Companys favour. In September 2018, the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) ruled that the marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, as well as the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium sales and purchasing agreements, were in full compliance with Canadian law for the tax years in question. Management believes the principles in the decision apply to all subsequent tax years, and that the ultimate resolution of those years will not be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution. The total tax reassessed for the three tax years was $ 11,000,000 , and Cameco remitted 50 %. In 2021, Cameco received refunds totaling about $ 5,500,000 plus interest. In addition, on April 30, 2019, the Tax Court had awarded Cameco $ 10,300,000 for legal fees incurred, plus an amount for disbursements of up to $ 16,700,000 . As a result of additional information provided by the Tax Court, $ 12,200,000 for disbursements was recognized as a reduction of administration expense in 2021. If CRA continues to pursue reassessments for tax years subsequent to 2006, Cameco will continue to utilize its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules. G.

Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. When acquiring an additional interest in a joint arrangement, previously held interests are not remeasured at fair value. In an acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not constitute a business, the directly attributable transaction costs are included in the cost of the asset or group of assets."

Capital management Camecos management considers its capital structure to consist of bank overdrafts, long-term debt, short-term debt (net of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments), non-controlling interest and shareholders equity. Despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy, Camecos approach to capital management has remained consistent. Camecos capital structure reflects its strategy and the environment in which it operates. Delivering returns to long- term shareholders is a top priority.

A. Reclamation provision Cameco's estimates of future decommissioning obligations are based on reclamation standards that satisfy regulatory requirements. Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future decommissioning and reclamation costs for its existing operating assets to be $ 1,356,092,000 (2021 - $ 1,100,378,000 ). The expected timing of these outflows is based on life-of-mine plans with the majority of expenditures expected to occur after 2028 . These estimates are reviewed by Cameco technical personnel as required by regulatory agencies or more frequently as circumstances warrant. In connection with future decommissioning and reclamation costs, Cameco has provided financial assurances of $ 1,035,348,000 (2021 - $ 1,007,009,000 ) in the form of letters of credit to satisfy current regulatory requirements. The reclamation provision relates to the following segments: 2022 2021 Uranium $ 870,877 $ 900,482 Fuel services 190,219 226,487 Total $ 1,061,096 $ 1,126,969 B. Waste disposal The fuel services segment consists of the Blind River refinery, Port Hope conversion facility and Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.. The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium contaminated waste. These include contaminated combustible material (paper, rags, gloves, etc.) and contaminated non-combustible material (metal parts, soil from excavations, building and roofing materials, spent uranium concentrate drums, etc.). These materials can in some instances be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 8,919,000 (2021 - $ 8,169,000 ). The majority of these expenditures are expected to occur within the next four years."

Related parties A. Transactions with key management personnel Key management personnel are those persons that have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company, directly or indirectly. Key management personnel of the Company include executive officers, vice-presidents, other senior managers and members of the board of directors. In addition to their salaries, Cameco also provides non-cash benefits to executive officers and vice-presidents and contributes to pension plans on their behalf (note 26). Senior management and directors also participate in the Companys share-based compensation plans (note 25). Executive officers are subject to terms of notice ranging from three to six months. Upon resignation at the Companys request, they are entitled to termination benefits of up to the lesser of 18 to 24 months or the period remaining until age 65. The termination benefits include gross salary plus the target short-term incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs.

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based on a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and therefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery. Cameco expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period is less than a year. The following table summarizes Camecos sales disaggregated by geographical region and contract type and includes a reconciliation to the Companys reportable segments (note 29): For the year ended December 31, 2022 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 806,915 $ 289,028 $ 20,025 $ 1,115,968 Europe 284,602 52,112 2,769 339,483 Asia 388,629 23,923 - 412,552 $ 1,480,146 $ 365,063 $ 22,794 $ 1,868,003 Contract type Fixed-price $ 478,552 $ 355,479 $ 22,794 $ 856,825 Market-related 1,001,594 9,584 - 1,011,178 $ 1,480,146 $ 365,063 $ 22,794 $ 1,868,003 For the year ended December 31, 2021 Uranium Fuel services Other Total Customer geographical region Americas $ 547,257 $ 287,802 $ 12,769 $ 847,828 Europe 218,879 77,110 2,945 298,934 Asia 288,857 39,365 - 328,222 $ 1,054,993 $ 404,277 $ 15,714 $ 1,474,984 Contract type Fixed-price $ 307,858 $ 384,065 $ 11,421 $ 703,344 Market-related 747,135 20,212 4,293 771,640 $ 1,054,993 $ 404,277 $ 15,714 $ 1,474,984 Deferred sales The following table provides information about contract liabilities (note 15) from contracts with customers: 2022 2021 Beginning of year $ 23,316 $ 14,382 Additions 45,978 16,531 Recognized in revenue (2,463) (7,596) Effect of movements in exchange rates 14 (1) End of year $ 66,845 $ 23,316 Deferred sales primarily relates to advance consideration received from customers for future uranium and conversion deliveries as well as revenue related to the storage of uranium and converted uranium held at Cameco facilities. The revenue related to storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future uranium and conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 2023 and 2030. Cameco recognized a decrease of revenue of $ 194,000 (2021 - increase of revenue of $ 383,000 ) during 2022 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This is due to the difference between actual pricing indices and the estimates at the time of invoicing. Future sales commitments Camecos sales portfolio consists of short and long-term sales commitments. The contracts can be executed well in advance of a delivery and include both fixed and market-related pricing. The following table summarizes the expected future revenue, by segment, related to only fixed-price contracts with remaining future deliveries as follows: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Uranium $ 556,122 $ 629,675 $ 627,534 $ 237,052 $ 238,354 $ 622,034 $ 2,910,771 Fuel services 339,355 355,915 329,091 244,236 235,089 1,016,232 2,519,918 Total $ 895,477 $ 985,590 $ 956,625 $ 481,288 $ 473,443 $ 1,638,266 $ 5,430,689 The sales contracts are denominated largely in US dollars and converted from US to Canadian dollars at a rate of $ 1.30 . The amounts in the table represent the consideration the Company will be entitled to receive when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing. The Company has elected to exclude these amounts from the table as the transaction price will not be known until the time of delivery. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less have been included in the table."

Share-based compensation plans The Company has the following plans: A. Stock option plan The Company has established a stock option plan under which options to purchase common shares may be granted to employees of Cameco. Options granted under the stock option plan have an exercise price of not less than the closing price quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options carry vesting periods of one to three years , and expire eight years from the date granted. The aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Cameco stock option plan shall not exceed 43,017,198 of which 30,538,777 shares have been issued. Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2022 2021 Beginning of year 3,458,001 6,158,539 Options granted - - Options forfeited - (18,005) Options expired (2,475) (886,009) Options exercised [note 17] (401,955) (1,796,524) End of year 3,053,571 3,458,001 Exercisable 3,053,571 3,162,415 Weighted average share prices were as follows: 2022 2021 Beginning of year $16.72 $16.98 Options granted - - Options forfeited - 26.08 Options expired 26.81 22.05 Options exercised 23.96 14.90 End of year $15.75 $16.72 Exercisable $15.75 $16.85 The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise during 2022 was $ 23.96 per share (2021 - $ 22.09 ). Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2022 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $ 11.32 - 15.83 1,772,271 3.2 $14.57 1,772,271 $14.57 $ 15.84 - 19.3 1,281,300 0.8 $17.39 1,281,300 $17.39 3,053,571 3,053,571 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from March 1, 2023 to February 28, 2027. B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the participants discretion provided they have met their ownership requirements, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period is based on Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . If the participant elects a cash payout, the redemption amount will be based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Camecos common shares on March 1 or, if March 1 is not a trading day, on the first trading day following March 1. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of PSUs held by the participants, after adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,255,255 (2021 - 1,495,709 ). C. Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. These same participants, if they have met or are not subject to share ownership requirements, may elect to have their award paid as a lump sum cash amount. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 1,131,493 (2021 - 1,081,783 ). D. Phantom stock option The Company has established a phantom stock option plan for eligible non-North American employees. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2022, the number of options held by participating employees was 94,135 (2021 - 173,835 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.32 to $ 19.30 per share (2021 - $ 11.32 to $ 26.81 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 12.55 (2021 - $ 13.88 ). E. Phantom restricted share unit (PRSU) The Company has established a PRSU plan whereby it provides non-North American employees an annual grant of PRSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PRSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of cash with an equivalent market value. The PRSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. In addition, certain eligible participants have a single vesting date on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of PRSUs held by the participants was 21,148 (2021 - 16,027 ). F. Employee share ownership plan Cameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contribution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each employee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2022, there were 2,603 participants in the plan (2021 - 2,301 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2022 with Company contributions was 116,530 (2021 - 149,822 ). In 2022, the Companys contributions totaled $ 3,541,000 (2021 - $ 3,301,000 ). G. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with the balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be redeemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the director. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of DSUs held by participating directors was 547,304 (2021 - 579,362 ). Equity-settled plans Cameco records compensation expense under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed surplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2022 2021 Employee share ownership plan $ 3,541 $ 3,301 Restricted share unit plan 3,273 2,933 Performance share unit plan (a) - 1,237 Stock option plan 45 366 Total $ 6,859 $ 7,837 (a) There are no remaining PSUs whereby it is at the boards discretion whether shares will be purchased on the open market or redeemed for cash with an equivalent market value. Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled RSU plan were as follows: Grant date Mar 1/22 Number of options granted 129,910 Average strike price $31.17 Expected forfeitures 10% Weighted average grant date fair values $31.17 Cash-settled plans Cameco has recognized the following expenses under its cash-settled plans: 2022 2021 Performance share unit plan $ 11,221 $ 25,784 Restricted share unit plan 9,342 6,890 Deferred share unit plan 2,811 6,741 Phantom stock option plan 751 2,261 Phantom restricted share unit plan 244 163 Total $ 24,369 $ 41,839 At December 31, 2022, a liability of $ 59,577,000 (2021 - $ 61,030,000 ) was included in the consolidated statement of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and projections of the non-market criteria. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. The phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the March 1, 2022 grant date were as follows: Phantom PSU RSU RSU Number of units 238,610 159,140 10,142 Expected vesting 92% - - Expected dividend - - $0.08 Expected life of option 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected forfeitures 9% 9% 7% Weighted average measurement date fair values $31.17 $31.17 $31.17 The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the cash-settled share-based payment plans at the reporting date were as follows: Phantom Phantom stock options PSU RSU RSU Number of units 94,135 1,255,255 815,098 21,148 Expected vesting - 72% - - Average strike price $12.55 - - - Expected dividend $0.12 - - $0.12 Expected volatility 53% - - - Risk-free interest rate 3.8% - - - Expected life of option 3 years 0.7 years 0.8 years 1.4 years Expected forfeitures 7% 2% 8% 8% Weighted average measurement date fair values $20.22 $30.69 $30.69 $30.69 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The non- market criteria relating to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at both grant and reporting date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets."

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 8, 2023. B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Companys functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. Amounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5. This summary of significant accounting policies is a description of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instruments. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates. Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of the initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint venture. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicle. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The share of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. When acquiring an additional interest in a joint arrangement, previously held interests are not remeasured at fair value. In an acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not constitute a business, the directly attributable transaction costs are included in the cost of the asset or group of assets. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole, the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are measured at amortized cost. F. Short-term investments Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are measured at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage, costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset enters the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the economic benefits of the business combination. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Leases Cameco recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, in which case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated on the same basis as that of property, plant and equipment. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Companys incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Cameco uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Current borrowing rates available for classes of leased assets are compared with the rates of Camecos existing debt facilities to ensure that use of the Companys incremental borrowing rate is reasonable. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. Cameco uses judgement in determining the lease term for some lease contracts that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short- term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and costs incurred on redemption of debentures. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i. Non-derivative financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allowances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12- month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, a breach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed throughout the year to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed throughout the year, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost. i. Environmental restoration The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re- measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. When the terms and conditions of equity-settled plans at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services, fabrication services and other services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products, except in limited circumstances. Camecos sales arrangements with its customers are pursuant to enforceable contracts that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days. Each delivery is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to conversion facilities (Converters). For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Converters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and Cameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium to its customers. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another location based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and associated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portion of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facilities on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered. R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another. Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. i. Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets would not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilities On initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. iii. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2022 and 2021. S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposure will materialize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill. W. Government assistance Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company has complied with the relevant conditions of the grant and that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses have been recognized."

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 7, 2018 . B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Company s functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars , unless otherwise noted. A mounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated f inancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value Available-for-sale financial assets Fair value Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements Fair value Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods a ffected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5 . This summary of significant accounting policies is a desc ription of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been app lied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goo dwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired an d liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previ ously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair val ue, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instrume nts. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transfer red to the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subse quently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint vent ure. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabil ities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consoli dated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accor dance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicl e. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, wher eby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The shar e of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions , and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investm ent to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statem ents are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that ar e measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of forei gn exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, inc luding goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the date s of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole , the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the g ain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. F. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products ar e measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. G. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipme nt are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the loca tion and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area a re deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against t he property until the production stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and de preciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date o f the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is no t limited to, the demonstration of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as sub stantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset ente rs the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount o f the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. H. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired . At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the ec onomic benefits of the business combination . Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently a t cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite us eful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. I. Leased assets Leases which result in the Company receiving substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial re cognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between finance cost and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance cost is allocated to each period of the lease term to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Lease agreements that do not meet the recognition criteria of a finance lease are classified and recognized as operatin g leases and are not recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. J. Finance income and finance costs Finance income co mprises interest income on f unds invested and gains on the disposal of availa ble-for-sale financial assets . Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue , using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and costs incurred on redemption of debentures . Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the per iod incurred. K. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probab le future economic benefits. L. Impairment i. Non-derivative financial assets Financial assets not classified as fair value through profit and loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment. O bjective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debt or or issuer will enter bankruptcy, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. Impa irment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognized by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in equity, to earnings. The cumulative loss that is removed from other comprehensi ve income and recognized in earnings is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal payment and amortization, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in earnings. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in earnings, then the impairment loss is reversed through earnings, otherwise, it is reversed through other comprehensive income. Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity securities that are recognized in earnings are never reversed through earnings. ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets a re reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows , discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allo cated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the im pairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. M. Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extr acting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The te chnical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation cost s that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. N. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are dete rmined by discounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost . i. Environmental restorat ion The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of wast e materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs u sing information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact t he ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their p resent value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and r estoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expens e recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refi ning, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is disposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recogn ized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subsequent measurement. O. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no le gal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized i n the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated an nually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. Th e present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have te rms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods du ring which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-retirement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits ar e accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination ben efits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination be nefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounte d to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, ove r the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an exp ense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability ar e recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unr estricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. P. Revenue recognition Cameco supplies uranium concentrates and uranium conversion services to utility customers. Cameco recognizes revenue on the sal e of its nuclear products when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and collection is reasonably assured. Camecos sales are pursuant to an enforceable contract that indicates the type of sales arrangement, pricing and delivery terms, as well as details related to the transfer of title. Cameco has three types of sales arrangements with its customers in its uranium and fuel services businesses. These arrangements include uranium supply, toll conversion services and conversion supply (conve rted uranium), which is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium is physically del ivered to conversion facilities (Converters) where the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractu ally specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and Cameco invoices the customer and recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversio n services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delive rs converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contra ctually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the customers account. At this point, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and Cameco invoices the customer and recognizes revenue for the toll conversi on services. Conversion supply In a conversion supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converted uranium of acceptable origins to its customers. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physi cally delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually s pecified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a customers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and Cameco invoices the customer and recognize s revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided. Q. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another. i. Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities At initial recognition, Cameco classifies each of its financial assets and financial liabilities into one of the following categories: Fair value through profit or loss A financial asset or liab ility is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Cameco classifies a financial instrument as held-for-trading if it was acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or if it is part of a portfolio with evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in earnings as incurred. These financial assets and financia l liabilities are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses on revaluation being recognized in earnings. Held-to-maturity Held-to-maturity investments are financial assets that an entity has the intention and ability to hold until maturity, provide fixed or determinable payments and contain a fixed maturity date. Assets in this category are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets that provide fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market. Assets in this category are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction co sts and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified into any of the other categories. These assets are measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs with any gains or losses on re-measurement recognized in other comprehensive income. Accumulated changes in fair value are recorded as a separat e component of equity until the asset is derecognized or impaired, then the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to earnings. Other financial liabilities This category consists of all non-derivative financial liabilities tha t do not meet the definition of held-for-trading liabilities, and that have not been designated as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs a nd are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognized directly in equity. Transaction costs that are directly related to the probable issuance of a se curity that is classified as a financial liability is deducted from the amount of the financial liability when it is initially recognized, or recognized in earnings when the issuance is no longer probable. Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the con tractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. ii. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Except for those designated as hedging instruments, all derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transaction costs recognized in earnings as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in t he fair val ue of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investm ent in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Separable embedded derivatives Derivatives may be embedded in other financial instruments or executor y contracts (the  host instrument  ). Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument, the terms of the embedded derivative are the sa me as those of a stand-alone derivative, and the combined contract is not designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in earnings through gains or losses on derivatives. R. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets a nd liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporar y differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, a nd they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simul taneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets a re reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that t his exposure will materialize. S. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. T. Earnings per share The Com pany presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted e arnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. U. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Segment capita l expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill."

Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goo dwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired an d liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previ ously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair val ue, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instrume nts."

Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subse quently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized."

Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that ar e measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of forei gn exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii.

After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and de preciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date o f the production stage are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site.

For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period.

Non-derivative financial assets Financial assets not classified as fair value through profit and loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment. O bjective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debt or or issuer will enter bankruptcy, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. Impa irment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognized by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in equity, to earnings. The cumulative loss that is removed from other comprehensi ve income and recognized in earnings is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal payment and amortization, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in earnings. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in earnings, then the impairment loss is reversed through earnings, otherwise, it is reversed through other comprehensive income. Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity securities that are recognized in earnings are never reversed through earnings."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets a re reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows , discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allo cated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the im pairment may have reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Exploration and evaluation expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extr acting a mineral resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The te chnical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is determined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation cost s that have been acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment."

Environmental restorat ion The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of wast e materials, as well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs u sing information available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact t he ultimate closure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their p resent value using a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and r estoration activities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expens e recognized in finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

Cameco has three types of sales arrangements with its customers in its uranium and fuel services businesses. These arrangements include uranium supply, toll conversion services and conversion supply (conve rted uranium), which is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its customers. Cameco-owned uranium is physically del ivered to conversion facilities (Converters) where the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uranium. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractu ally specified quantity of uranium to the customers account at the Converters facility. At this point, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and Cameco invoices the customer and recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversio n services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment.

Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in t he fair val ue of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item.

Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities At initial recognition, Cameco classifies each of its financial assets and financial liabilities into one of the following categories: Fair value through profit or loss A financial asset or liab ility is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Cameco classifies a financial instrument as held-for-trading if it was acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or if it is part of a portfolio with evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in earnings as incurred. These financial assets and financia l liabilities are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses on revaluation being recognized in earnings. Held-to-maturity Held-to-maturity investments are financial assets that an entity has the intention and ability to hold until maturity, provide fixed or determinable payments and contain a fixed maturity date. Assets in this category are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets that provide fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market. Assets in this category are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction co sts and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified into any of the other categories. These assets are measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs with any gains or losses on re-measurement recognized in other comprehensive income. Accumulated changes in fair value are recorded as a separat e component of equity until the asset is derecognized or impaired, then the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to earnings. Other financial liabilities This category consists of all non-derivative financial liabilities tha t do not meet the definition of held-for-trading liabilities, and that have not been designated as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs a nd are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognized directly in equity. Transaction costs that are directly related to the probable issuance of a se curity that is classified as a financial liability is deducted from the amount of the financial liability when it is initially recognized, or recognized in earnings when the issuance is no longer probable. Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the con tractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire."

Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets a nd liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporar y differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, a nd they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simul taneously.

Certain of the contractual commitments may contain cancellation clauses, however the Company discloses the commitments based on managements intent to fulfill the contract. The majority of this amount is expected to be incurred in 201 8 . (a) During 2017, revenues of $ 29,305,000 from the sales of inventories before the commence ment of commercial production of JV Inkai Block 3 are recorded as a reduction of the respective mining assets. (b) In the fourth quarter of 2017, all remaining proven and probable reserves of our US operations were reclassified to resources, indicating th at the mineable remaining pounds of U 3 O 8 no longer have demonstrated economic viability, but have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator tha t the assets of the two cash generating units in the US could potentially be impaired and accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets. An impairment charge of $ 184,448,000 ($ 144,450,000 (USD)) was recognized as part of the uranium segment. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of the carrying value over the recoverable amount which was based on a fair value less costs to sell model and categorized as a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. The rec overable amount was determined to be $ 133,228,000 ($ 106,200,000 (USD)) based on the fair value of resources in place using comparable market metrics. (c) Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, Cameco announced the planned temporary suspension of production at the McArthur River/Key Lake operation. Due to this announcement, the Key Lake calciner project, which is part of the uranium segment and was initially undertaken to allow for an increase in annual production, was re-evaluated. As a result, the Company wro te off $ 55,333,000 of assets under construction on this project. (d) In the fourth quarter of 2016, Cameco recognized a $ 237,621 ,000 impairment charge rela ting to Kintyre, its uranium exploration project in Australia. Due to the w eakening of the uranium m arket and the budget decision not to commit further expenditures to the project , the Company concluded it was appropriate to recognize an impairment charge. The charge was for the full carrying value of the CGU. (e) In the second quarter of 2016, producti on was suspended at our Rabbit Lake operation in northern Saskatchewan. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator that the assets of the cash generating unit could potentially be impaired a nd accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets . An impairment charge of $ 124,368,000 was recognized as part of the uranium segment. The charge was for the full carrying value of this cash generating unit. The recoverabl e amount of the mine and mill was based on a fair value less costs to sell model, which incorporated the future cash flows, including care and maintenance costs, expected to be derived from the operation. It was categorized as a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. The discount rate used in the fair value less costs to sell calculation was 8 % and was determined based on a market participants incremental borrowing cost, adjusted for the marginal return that the participant would expect to use on an investment in the mine and mill. Other key assumptions included uranium price forecasts and operating and capital cost forecasts.

(b) In the fourth quarter of 2017, all remaining proven and probable reserves of our US operations were reclassified to resources, indicating th at the mineable remaining pounds of U 3 O 8 no longer have demonstrated economic viability, but have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator tha t the assets of the two cash generating units in the US could potentially be impaired and accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets. An impairment charge of $ 184,448,000 ($ 144,450,000 (USD)) was recognized as part of the uranium segment. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of the carrying value over the recoverable amount which was based on a fair value less costs to sell model and categorized as a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. The rec overable amount was determined to be $ 133,228,000 ($ 106,200,000 (USD)) based on the fair value of resources in place using comparable market metrics. (c) Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, Cameco announced the planned temporary suspension of production at the McArthur River/Key Lake operation. Due to this announcement, the Key Lake calciner project, which is part of the uranium segment and was initially undertaken to allow for an increase in annual production, was re-evaluated. As a result, the Company wro te off $ 55,333,000 of assets under construction on this project. (d) In the fourth quarter of 2016, Cameco recognized a $ 237,621 ,000 impairment charge rela ting to Kintyre, its uranium exploration project in Australia. Due to the w eakening of the uranium m arket and the budget decision not to commit further expenditures to the project , the Company concluded it was appropriate to recognize an impairment charge. The charge was for the full carrying value of the CGU. (e) In the second quarter of 2016, producti on was suspended at our Rabbit Lake operation in northern Saskatchewan. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator that the assets of the cash generating unit could potentially be impaired a nd accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets . An impairment charge of $ 124,368,000 was recognized as part of the uranium segment. The charge was for the full carrying value of this cash generating unit. The recoverabl e amount of the mine and mill was based on a fair value less costs to sell model, which incorporated the future cash flows, including care and maintenance costs, expected to be derived from the operation. It was categorized as a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. The discount rate used in the fair value less costs to sell calculation was 8 % and was determined based on a market participants incremental borrowing cost, adjusted for the marginal return that the participant would expect to use on an investment in the mine and mill. Other key assumptions included uranium price forecasts and operating and capital cost forecasts. Uranium prices applied in the calculation were based on approved internal price forecasts, which reflect managements expecta tion of prices that a market participant would use.

Amortization T he intangible asset values relate to intellectual property acquired with Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc. (CFM) and purchase and sales contracts acquired with NUKEM. The CFM intellectual property is being amortized on a unit-of-production basis over its remaining life. Amortization is allocated to the cost of inventory and is recognized in cost of products and services sold as inventory is sold. The NUKEM purchase and sales contracts will be amortized to earnings over the remaining terms of the underlying contracts, which extend to 2022. Amortization of the purchase contracts is allocated to the cost of inventory and is included in cost of products and services sold as inventory is sold. Sa les contracts are amortized to revenue. A pproximate ly $ 998,000 of pre-tax earnings (in USD) relating to the amortization of the fair value allocated to the NUKEM contracts will be amortized in 2018 with the remaining balance being recognized fairly evenly each year through 2022. P atents acquired with UFP Investments LLC (UFP) were being amortized to cost of products and services sold on a straight-line basis over their remaining life which expires in July 2029. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Cameco recorded an impairment charge of $ 7,150,000 on these assets due to continuing weakness in the uranium market and limited budget allocated to this project. C. Impairment test F or the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is attributable to NUKEM, which is considered to be a CGU. In the third quarter of 2017 , Cameco restructured its global marketing organization in response to the changing business environment. The restructuring significantly impacts the marketing activities historically performed by NUKEM. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairm ent of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator that the as sets of the CGU could potentially be impaired and accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets . The recoverable amount of NUKEM was estimated based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation and was concluded to be equal to the carrying value of its inventory and existing contracts. A change in the previous assumption, that there would be cash flows generated beyond a five-year period, resulted in the elimination of the terminal value. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $ 111,399,000 ($ 88,377,000 (US)) was recorded, representing the full carrying value of NUKEM goodwill."

A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicl e. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, wher eby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings.

The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability ar e recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unr estricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased."

Reclamation provision Cameco's estimates of future decommissioning obligations are based on reclamation standards that satisfy regulatory requirements. Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties. Cameco estimates total future decommissioning and reclamation costs for its existing operating assets to be $ 1,051,746,000 ( 2016 - $ 1,037,302 ,000 ) . The expected timing of these outflows is based on life-of-mine plans with the majority of expenditu res expected to occur after 2022 .

Waste disposal The fuel services segment consists of the Blind River refinery, Port Hope conversion facility and Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc. . The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium contaminated waste. These include contaminated combustible material (paper, rags, gloves, etc.) and contaminated non-combustible material (metal parts, soil from excavations, building and roofing materials, spent uranium concentrate drums, etc.). These materials can in some instanc es be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 8,239 ,000 ( 2016 - $ 14,930 ,000 ).

Segmented information Cameco has three reportable segments: uranium, fuel services and NUKEM. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies . The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium concentrate. The fuel services segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services. The NUKEM segment acts as a mar ket intermediary between uranium producers and nuclear-electric utilities. In the third quarter of 2017, Cameco announced that the way its global marketing activities are organ ized would be changed. To better co-ordinate marketing activities and reduce cos ts, all future Canadian and international marketing activities will be consolidated in Saskatoon. These changes will have a significant impact on the activities historically performed by NUKEM and may change the factors that are considered in assessing the Companys reportable segments in the future . Accounting policies used in each segment are consistent with the policies outlined in the summary of significant accounting policies. Segment revenues, expenses and results include transactions between segments incurred in the ordinary course of business. These transactions are priced on an arms length basis, are eliminated on consolidation and are reflected in the other column. A.

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no le gal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized i n the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated an nually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. Th e present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have te rms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods du ring which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits ar e accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.

Based on projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are available, realization of these deferred tax assets is probable and consequentl y the deferred tax assets have been recorded . B.

This new legislation will not result in a significant impact on our financial statements as we derecognized the amounts related to our US deferred tax asset in 2015. At that time, it was determined that it was no longer probable that there would be sufficient taxable profit in the future against which the US operating losses and other tax deductions could be used. The change in legislation does however, significantly reduce th e value of our unrecognized US deferred tax assets due to the US tax rate decrease. In addition, we have alternative minimum tax credits of $ 4,073,000 US that will be refunded between 2018 and 2021 . D. Tax rate reconciliation T he provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the combined expected federal and provincial income tax rate to earnings before income taxes. The reasons for these differences are as follows: 2017 2016 Loss before income taxes and non-controlling interest $ (207,237) $ (154,234) Combined federal and provincial tax rate 26.7% 26.9% Computed income tax recovery (55,332) (41,489) Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: Difference between Canadian rates and rates applicable to subsidiaries in other countries (51,526) (175,092) Change in unrecognized deferred tax assets 70,353 106,766 Other taxes - (2,278) Share-based compensation plans 1,349 1,221 Change in tax provision related to transfer pricing 3,000 8,000 Non-deductible (non-taxable) capital amounts 3,034 - Change in legislation (12,199) - Non-deductible goodwill impairment 35,520 - Other permanent differences 3,282 8,517 Income tax recovery $ (2,519) $ (94,355) E.

Reassessments C anada In 2008, as part of the ongoing annual audits of Cameco's Canadian tax returns, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) disputed the transfer pricing structure and methodology used by Cameco and its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Cameco Europe Ltd., in respect of sale and purchase agreements for uranium products. From December 2008 to date, CRA issued notices of reassessment for the taxation years 2003 through 2011, which in aggregate have increased Cameco's income for Canadian tax purposes by a pproximately $ 4,100,000,000 . CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2011 in the amount of $ 371,000,000 . Cameco believes it is likely that CRA will reassess Cameco's tax returns for subsequent y ears on a similar basis and that these will require Cameco to make future remittances or provide security on receipt of the reassessments . Using the methodology we believe that CRA will continue to apply and including the $ 4,100,000,000 already reassessed , we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $ 8,400,000,000 for the years 2003 through 2017, which would increase Camecos income for Canadian tax purposes and result in a related tax expense of approximately $ 2,500,000,000 . In addition to penalties already imposed, CRA may continue to apply penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2011. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties would be between $ 1,950,000,000 and $ 2,150,000,000 . In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to Cameco. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise securing 50 % of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $ 970,000,000 and $ 1,070,000,000 ), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to Cameco . Under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be remitted each year will depend on the amount of income reassessed in th at year and the availability of elective deductions. Recently, the CRA disallowed the use of any loss carry-backs to be applied to any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to CRA, including cash taxes, interest and penalties totalling $ 303,222,000 already paid as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $ 264,042,000 ) (note 10 ). In addition to the cash remitted, we have provided $ 4 21,000,000 in letters of credit to secure 50 % of the cash taxes and related interest. The trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments concluded on September 13, 2017. We expect to have a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months of that date . Once the Tax Court has delivered a decision for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years we will consider how the decision relates to other years in issue (being 2004 and years subsequent to 2006). While the decision would not be legally binding for any year other than t he trial years, we expect the ultimate decision for the trial years to be an important factor in resolving the dispute for the other years in issue. Having regard to advice from its external advisors, Cameco's opinion is that CRA's position is incorrect an d Cameco is contesting CRA's position and expects to recover any amounts remitted or secured as a result of the reassessments. However, to reflect the uncertainties of CRA's appeals process and litigation, Cameco has recorded a cumulative tax provision rel ated to this matter for the years 2003 through the current period in the amount of $ 61,000,000 . While the resolution of this matter may result in liabilities that are higher or lower than the reserve, management believes that the ultimate resolution will n ot be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution. Resolution of this matter as stipulated by CRA would be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year( s) of resolution and other unfavourable outcomes for the years 2003 to date could be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution . Further to Cameco's decision to contest CRA's reassessments, Ca meco is pursuing its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules . G. Income tax losses A t December 31, 2017 , income tax losses carried forward of $2,609,070,000 ( 2016 - $ 2,432,772,000 ) are available to reduce taxable income.

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estima tes are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Furthe r details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets when there is an indication of possible impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use or with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually. If it is determined that carrying values of a ssets or goodwill cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements and mineral reserves. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generating units I n performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or g roups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the end of the usefu l lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amoun t charged to earnings. D. I ncome taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In calculating income taxes , consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates deferred income taxes based on temporary differenc es between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilitie s in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is de pendent on assumptions and judg ments regarding future market conditi ons, production rates and intercompany sales . If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earnings may be materially impacted. E. Commencement of production stage Until a mining property is declared as being in the production stage, all co sts related to its development are capitalized. The determination of the date on which a mine enters the production stage is a matter of judgment that impacts when capitalization of development costs ceases and depreciation of the mining property commences and is charged to earnings. Refer to note 2 (g )(ii) for further information on the criteria used to make this assessment. F. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This meth od allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates of life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amounts of depreciation charged to earnings. G. Purchase price allocations The p u rchase price related to a business combination or asset acquisition is allocated to the underlying acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value s at the time of acquisition. The determination of fair value requires Cameco to make assu mptions, estimates and judgments regarding future events. The allocation process is inherently subjective and impacts the amounts assigned to individually identifiable assets and liabilities. As a result, the purchase price allocation impacts Camecos repo rted assets and liabilities and future net earnings due to the impact on future depreciation and amortization expense and impairment tests. H. Determination of joint control Cameco conducts certain operations through joint ownership interests. Judgment is required in assessing whether Cameco has joint control over the investee, which involves determining the relevant activities of the arrangement and whether decisions around relevant activities require unanimous consent. Judgment is also required to determi ne whether a joint arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or joint operation. Classifying the arrangement requires us to assess our rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. Specifically, management considers the structure of the jo int arrangement and whether it is structured through a separate vehicle and when the arrangement is structured through a separate vehicle, we also consider the rights and obligations arising from the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the con tractual arrangements and other facts and circumstances, when relevant. This judgment influences whether we equity account or proportionately consolidate our interest in the arrangement."

Joint operations Cameco conducts a portion of its exploration, development, mining and milling activities through joint operations located around the world. Operations are governed by agreements that provide for joint control of the strategic operating, investing and financing activities among the partners. These agreements were considered in the determination of joint control. Camecos significant Canadian uranium joint operation interests are McArthur River, Key Lake and Cigar Lake. The Canad ian uranium joint operations allocate uranium production to each joint operation participant and the joint operation participant derives revenue directly from the sale of such product. The participants in the Inkai joint operation purchase uranium from Ink ai and, in turn, derive revenue directly from the sale of such product to third-party customers. Mining and milling expenses incurred by joint operations are included in the cost of inventory. Cameco reflects its proportionate interest in these assets and liabilities as follows: Principal place of business Ownership 2017 2016 Total assets McArthur River Canada 69.81% $ 1,121,509 $ 1,093,254 Key Lake Canada 83.33% 482,879 571,183 Cigar Lake Canada 50.03% 1,531,150 1,591,489 Inkai Kazakhstan 60.00% 230,280 290,122 $ 3,365,818 $ 3,546,048 Total liabilities McArthur River 69.81% $ 38,896 $ 43,189 Key Lake 83.33% 140,214 150,847 Cigar Lake 50.03% 40,687 37,888 Inkai 60.00% 119,998 181,145 $ 339,795 $ 413,069 Through unsecured shareholder loans, Cameco has agreed to fund the development of the Inkai project.

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental execu tive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP) , Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced ben efits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered bas e plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets curren tly held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cam eco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to elig ible employees and their depende nts. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for th e Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1,713 ,000 in contribution s and letter of credit fees to i ts defined benefit plans in 2018 . The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expo se Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective da te of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2015 . The next planned effective date f or valuations is January 1, 2018 . Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis tha t these plans are not exposed to materially different risks. Information relating to Camecos defined benefit plans is shown in the following table: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 8,652 $ 10,632 $ - $ - Interest income on plan assets 320 403 - - Return on assets excluding interest income (2) (127) - - Benefits paid (907) (2,254) - - Administrative costs paid (2) (2) - - Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 8,061 $ 8,652 $ - $ - Defined benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 54,930 $ 52,996 $ 23,421 $ 21,771 Current service cost 1,544 1,634 1,227 1,153 Interest cost 1,810 1,842 945 900 Actuarial loss arising from: - financial assumptions 3,840 677 2,076 373 - experience adjustment 2,403 1,605 50 161 Benefits paid (9,095) (2,970) (826) (937) Foreign exchange 540 (854) - - Defined benefit obligation, end of year $ 55,972 $ 54,930 $ 26,893 $ 23,421 Defined benefit liability [note 13] $ (47,911) $ (46,278) $ (26,893) $ (23,421) The percentages of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset category at December 31 were as follows: Pension benefit plans 2017 2016 Asset category (a) Canadian equity securities 8% 8% Global equity securities 16% 15% Canadian fixed income 27% 26% Other (b) 49% 51% Total 100% 100% (a) The defined benefit plan assets contain no material amounts of related p arty assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.

A 1% change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (7,103) $ 9,296 $ (3,693) $ 4,689 Rate of compensation increase 2,841 (2,598) n/a n/a A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financi al position of Cameco s plans as at December 31, 2017 . The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with t he methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 1,329 ,000 .

The options carry vesting periods of one to three years, and expire eight years from the date granted . The aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Cameco stock option plan shall not exceed 43,017,198 of which 27,870,28 9 shares have been issued. Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2017 2016 Beginning of year 8,020,311 8,503,238 Options granted 1,373,040 1,273,340 Options forfeited (564,423) (1,156,737) Options expired (504,052) (599,530) Options exercised [note 15] (210) - End of year 8,324,666 8,020,311 Exercisable 5,809,077 5,929,550 Weighted average exercise prices were as follows: 2017 2016 Beginning of year $23.61 $26.04 Options granted 14.70 16.38 Options forfeited 26.49 25.70 Options expired 19.50 38.81 Options exercised 19.37 - End of year $22.19 $23.61 Exercisable $24.95 $25.46 Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2017 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $14.70 - 20.22 3,527,303 5.7 $16.46 1,011,714 $18.08 $20.23 - 39.53 4,797,363 2.2 $26.41 4,797,363 $26.41 8,324,666 5,809,077 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from February 28, 2018 to February 28, 2025. B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period will be based on total shareholder return over the thr ee years, Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . As of December 31, 2017 , the total number of PSUs held by the participants, a fter adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,070,997 ( 2016 - 892,895 ). C. Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the boar d. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. As of December 31, 2017 , the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 463,151 ( 2016 - 557,957 ). D. Employee share ownership plan C ameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contri bution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each em ployee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2017 , there were 2,979 participants in the plan ( 2016 - 3,356 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2017 with Company contributions was 370,381 ( 2016 - 404,550 ). In 2017 , the Companys contributions totalled $ 4,473,000 ( 2016 - $ 5,204,000 ).

During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2017 2016 Stock option plan $ 4,941 $ 4,588 Performance share unit plan 6,186 5,572 Restricted share unit plan 2,833 3,941 Employee share ownership plan 4,473 5,204 End of year $ 18,433 $ 19,305 Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and the fair value of options granted under the stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurem ent of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment plans were as follows: Stock option plan PSU RSU Number of options granted 1,373,040 470,120 279,892 Average strike price $14.70 - $14.71 Expected dividend $0.40 - - Expected volatility 34% 36% - Risk-free interest rate 1.1% 0.9% - Expected life of option 4.7 years 3 years - Expected forfeitures 7% 9% 13% Weighted average grant date fair values $3.34 $14.72 $14.71 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The market condition based on total shareholder return was incorporated by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. The non-market criteria relat ing to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at grant date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets. The Company has the following cash-settled plans: A. Deferred share unit (DSU) C ameco offers a DSU p lan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, with t he balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . The DSUs will be redeemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Camec o on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the d irector. As of December 31, 2017 , the total number of DSUs held by participating direc tors was 452,981 ( 2016 - 514,352 ). B. Phantom stoc k option C ameco makes annual grants of bonuses to eligible non-North American employees in the form of phantom stock options. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2017 , the number of options held by participating employees was 391,714 ( 2016 - 347,858 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 14.70 to $ 39.53 per share ( 2016 - $ 16.38 to $ 39.53 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 22.13 ( 2016 - $ 24.13 ).

Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the phantom stock option plan at the grant and reporting dates were as follows: Grant date Reporting date March 1, 2017 December 31, 2017 Number of units 127,595 391,714 Average strike price $14.70 $22.13 Expected dividend $0.40 $0.08 Expected volatility 33% 38% Risk-free interest rate 1.1% 1.7% Expected life of option 4.5 years 3.3 years Expected forfeitures 7% 7% Weighted average measurement date fair values $3.28 $1.35"

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will aff ect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow d enominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency , interest rate and comm odity contracts change . The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk A s a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Companys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and retention of exp osure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates and pricing me chanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. Cameco is exposed to commodity price risk through its use of a uranium contract derivative. As of the reporting date, a 30 % decrease in the price of uranium based on the Numerco forward uranium price curve, would result in a loss on this derivative of $ 7,516,000 ($ 5,770,000 (US)). A 30% increase would have an equal but opposite impact. B. Foreign exchange risk T he relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects financial results of t he uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cameco attempts to p rovide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a price for future d elivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuations because a port ion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign exchange risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents EUR $ 23,495 $ 1,175 Cash and cash equivalents USD 149,655 7,483 Accounts receivable USD 333,240 16,662 Accounts receivable KZT 42,032 2,212 Long-term receivables, investments and other USD 58,820 2,941 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (88,281) (4,414) Net foreign currency derivatives USD 34,360 (59,965) A 5% strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2017 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk T he Company has a strategy of minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved pol icy limits. At December 31, 2017 , the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 80 % ( 2016 - 80 %). Cameco is exposed to interest rate risk through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 300,000,000 of the Series D senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. The swaps terminate on September 2, 2019. Under the terms of the swaps, Cameco makes intere st payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 3.7 % and receives fixed interest payments of 5.67 %. At December 31, 2017 , the fair value of Cam ecos interest rate swap net liability was $ 150,000 ( 2016 - asset of $ 6,547 ,000 ). Cameco is also exposed to interest rate risk on its loan facility with Inkai due to the varia ble nature of the interest rate contained in the terms therein (note 29 ) . Cameco measures its exposure to interest rate risk as the change in c ash flows that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in interest rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined the impact on earnings of a 1 % increase in interest rate on variable rate fi nancial instruments to be as follows: Gain (loss) Interest rate contracts $ (3,009) Advances receivable from Inkai 611 Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non-payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers and seeking p re-payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. To mitigate risks associated with certain financial assets, Cameco will hold positions with a variety of large creditworthy institutions. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 591,620 $ 320,278 Accounts receivable [note 6] 393,213 238,514 Advances receivable from Inkai [note 29] 58,820 90,095 Derivative assets [note 10] 40,804 10,612 Other - 4,966 At December 31, 2017 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. All accounts receivable at the reporting date are neither past due nor impaired. Cameco has established programs for sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable to financial institutions. Through these programs, the Company s urrenders the control, risks and benefits associated with the accounts receivable sold. The amount of receivables sold is recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed from the consolidated statement of financial position at the time of sale. The total amount of receivables sold under these programs and derecognized in accordance with IAS 39 during 2017 was $ 120,470 ,000 ($ 92,805 ,000 (USD)) ( 2016 - $ 214,428 ,000 ($ 159,551 ,000 (USD))). Liquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cas h and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements.

The carrying value of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates its fair value as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that are cl assified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value C ameco measures its derivative financial instruments, material investments in equity securities and long-term debt at fair value. Investments in publicly held equity securities are classified as a recurring level 1 fair value measurement while derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity securities is determin ed using quoted share prices observed in the principal market for the securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 1.6 % to 2.3 % ( 2016 - 0.8 % to 2.3 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forw ard contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the difference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. T he fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward interest rate curves. Uranium contract derivatives consist of written options and price swaps. The fair value of uranium options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of uranium price swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed purchases or sales under contracted prices, and floating purchases or sales based on Numerco forward uranium price curves. Where applicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date.

Revenue In May 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 15, Re venue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15). IFRS 15 is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and is to be applied retrospectively. IFRS 15 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. Our assessme nt primarily involved reviewing our sales contracts to determine if any performance obligations exist that will need to be separately identified that may affect the timing of when revenue will be recognized under IFRS 15. Based on o ur assessment , Cameco ha s not identified any material impacts on the timing and measurement of revenue from our existing revenue recognition practices from the adoption of the new standard , however we do expect to have additional disclosures. ii. Financial instruments In July 2014, t he IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9). IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39). IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and new hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward, from IAS 39, guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments. IFRS 9 is effective for annua l periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption of the new standard permitted. Cameco does not apply hedge accounting and does not currently intend to apply hedge accounting upon adoption of IFRS 9. Based on our assessment, we do not e xpect adoption of the standard to have a material impact on the financial statements, however we do expect to have additional disclosures . iii . Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases (IFRS 16). IFRS 16 is effective for periods beginning on or a fter January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet acc ounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. The extent of the impact of adoption of IFRS 16 has not yet been determined . iv. Income tax In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (IFRIC 23) . IFRIC 23 i s effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the accounting for current and deferred tax liabilities and assets in circumstances in which there is uncertainty over income tax tr eatments. The extent of the impact of the adoption of IFRIC 23 has not yet been determined."

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes fo r assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data whe n available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants w ould use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inpu ts that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair valu e measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measuremen t in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not ha ve any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 8 - Property, plant and equ ipment Note 9 - Goodwill and intangible assets Note 22 - Share-based compensation plans Note 24 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Amortization The intangible asset values relate to intellectual property acquired with Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc. (CFM) and purchase and sales contracts acquired with NUKEM. The CFM intellectual property is being amortized on a unit-of-production basis over its remaining life. Amortization is allocated to the cost of inventory and is recognized in cost of products and services sold as inventory is sold. The NUKEM purchase and sales contracts will be amortized to earnings over the remaining terms of the underlying contracts, which extend to 2022. Amortization of the purchase contracts is allocated to the cost of inventory and is included in cost of products and services sold as inventory is sold. Sa les contracts are amortized to revenue. P atents acquired with UFP Investments LLC (UFP) were being amortized to cost of products and services sold on a straight-line basis over their remaining life which expires in July 2029. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Cameco recorded an impairment charge of $ 7,150,000 on these assets due to continuing weakness in the uranium market and limited budget allocated to this project. C. Impairment test For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is attributable to NUKEM, which is considered to be a CGU. In the third quarter of 2017 , Cameco restructured its global marketing organization in response to the changing business environment. The res tructuring significantly impacted the marketing activities historically performed by NUKEM. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets , Cameco considered this to be an indicator that the as sets of the CGU could po tentially be impaired and accordingly, we were required to estimate the recoverable amount of these assets . The recoverable amount of NUKEM was estimated based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation and was concluded to be equal to the carrying val ue of its inventory and existing contracts. A change in the previous assumption, that there would be cash flows generated beyond a five-year period, resulted in the elimination of the terminal value. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $ 111,399,000 ($ 88,3 77,000 (US)) was recorded, representing the full carrying value of NUKEM goodwill."

Cameco Corporation Cameco Corporation is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The address of its registered office is 2121 11th Street West, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7M 1J3. The consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2018 comprise Cameco Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or Cameco) and the Companys interests in ass ociates and joint arrangements. Cameco is one of the worlds largest providers of the uranium needed to generate clean, reliabl e baseload electricity around the globe. The Company currently has one mine operating in northern Saskatchewan, Cigar Lake, as well as a 40% interest in Joint Venture Inkai LLP (JV Inkai), a joint arrangement with Joint Stock Company National Atomic Compan y Kazatomprom (Kazatomprom) , located in Kazakhstan. As of January 1, 2018, JV Inkai is accounted for on an equity basis (see note 11 ). Previously, JV Inkais results were proportionately consolidated therefore Camecos 2017 results reflect its propor tionate share of JV Inkais assets, liabilities, revenues , expenses and cash flows. It also has two operations in Northern Saskatchewan which are in care and maintenance. Rabbit Lake was placed in care and maintenance in the second quarter of 2016 while ope rations at McArthur River/Key Lake were suspended indefinitely in the third quarter of 2018 (see note 28 for financial statement impact). Camecos operations in the United States, Crow Butte and Smith Ranch-Highland, are also not currently producing as the decision was made in 2016 to curtail production and defer all wellfield development. The Company is also a leading provider of nuclear fuel processing services, supplying much of the worlds reactor fleet with the fuel to generate one of the cleanest sources of electricity available today. It operates the worlds largest commercial refinery in Blind River, Ontario, controls about 25% of the world UF 6 primary conversion capacity in Port Hope, Ontario and is a leading manufacturer of fuel assemblies and reactor components for CANDU reactors at facilities in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario ."

Share-based compensation plans The Company has the following equity-settled plans: A. Stock option plan T he Company has established a stock option plan under which options to purchase common shares may be granted to employees of Cameco. Options granted under the stock option plan have an exercise price of not less than the closing price quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options carry vesting periods of one to three years, and expire eight years from the date granted . The aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Cameco stock option plan shall not exceed 43,017,198 of which 27,870,28 9 shares have been issued. Stock option transactions for the respective years were as follows: (Number of options) 2018 2017 Beginning of year 8,324,666 8,020,311 Options granted 1,473,430 1,373,040 Options forfeited (315,340) (564,423) Options expired (661,951) (504,052) Options exercised [note 16] - (210) End of year 8,820,805 8,324,666 Exercisable 6,007,557 5,809,077 Weighted average exercise prices were as follows: 2018 2017 Beginning of year $22.19 $23.61 Options granted 11.32 14.70 Options forfeited 25.43 26.49 Options expired 28.90 19.50 Options exercised - 19.37 End of year $19.75 $22.19 Exercisable $22.83 $24.95 Total options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Option price per share Number Weighted average remaining life Weighted average exercisable price Number Weighted average exercisable price $11.32 - 17.84 4,119,810 5.8 $14.01 1,306,562 $15.79 $17.85 - 39.53 4,700,995 2 $24.79 4,700,995 $24.79 8,820,805 6,007,557 The foregoing options have expiry dates ranging from February 28, 2019 to February 28, 2026. B. Executive performance share unit (PSU) The Company has established a PSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of PSUs in an amount determined by the board. Each PSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion, at the end of each three-year period if certain performance and vesting criteria have been met. The final value of the PSUs will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the three-year period and the number of PSUs that ultimately vest. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. Vesting of PSUs at the end of the three-year period will be based on total shareholder return over the thr ee years, Camecos ability to meet its annual operating targets and whether the participating executive remains employed by Cameco at the end of the three-year vesting period . As of December 31, 2018 , the total number of PSUs held by the participants, a fter adjusting for forfeitures on retirement, was 1,343,971 ( 2017 - 1,070,997 ). C. Restricted share unit (RSU) The Company has established an RSU plan whereby it provides each plan participant an annual grant of RSUs in an amount determined by the bo ard. Each RSU represents one phantom common share that entitles the participant to a payment of one Cameco common share purchased on the open market, or cash with an equivalent market value, at the boards discretion. The RSUs carry vesting periods of one to three years , and the final value of the units will be based on the value of Cameco common shares at the end of the vesting periods. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. As of December 31, 2018 , the total number of RSUs held by the participants was 456,704, ( 2017 - 463,151 ). D. Employee share ownership plan Cameco also has an employee share ownership plan, whereby both employee and Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Companys contributions are expensed during the year of contri bution. Under the plan, employees have the opportunity to participate in the program to a maximum of 6% of eligible earnings each year with Cameco matching the first 3% of employee-paid shares by 50%. Cameco contributes $1,000 of shares annually to each em ployee that is enrolled in the plan . Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted 12 months from the date on which such shares were purchased . At December 31, 2018 , there were 2,317 participants in the plan ( 2017 - 2,979 ). The total number of shares purchased in 2018 with Company contributions was 304,147 ( 2017 - 370,381 ). In 2018 , the Companys contributions totaled $ 3,845,000 ( 2017 - $ 4,473,000 ). Cameco records compensation expens e under its equity-settled plans with an offsetting credit to contributed surplus, to reflect the estimated fair value of units granted to employees. During the year, the Company recognized the following expenses under these plans: 2018 2017 Stock option plan $ 4,744 $ 4,941 Performance share unit plan 7,690 6,186 Restricted share unit plan 2,542 2,833 Employee share ownership plan 3,845 4,473 Total $ 18,821 $ 18,433 Fair value measurement of equity-settled plans The fair value of the units granted through the PSU plan was determined based on Monte Carlo simulation and the fair value of options granted under the stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs granted was determined based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurem ent of the fair values at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment plans were as follows: Stock option plan PSU RSU Number of options granted 1,473,430 602,530 377,021 Average strike price $11.32 - $11.46 Expected dividend $0.08 - - Expected volatility 35% 37% - Risk-free interest rate 2.0% 1.9% - Expected life of option 4.8 years 3 years - Expected forfeitures 7% 9% 13% Weighted average grant date fair values $3.48 $11.43 $11.46 In addition to these inputs, other features of the PSU grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. The market condition based on total shareholder return was incorporated by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. The non-market criteria relat ing to realized selling prices and operating targets have been incorporated into the valuation at grant date by reviewing prior history and corporate budgets. The Company has the following cash-settled plans: A. Deferred share unit (DSU) Cameco offers a DSU plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. 60% of each directors annual retainer is paid in DSUs. In addition, on an annual basis, directors can elect to receive 25%, 50% , 75% or 100% of the remaining 40% of their annual retainer and any additional fees in the form of DSUs . If a director meets their ownership requirements, the director may elect to take 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their annual retainer and any fees in cash, w ith the balance, if any, to be paid in DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award . Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units as of each normal cash dividend payment date of Camecos common shares. The DSUs will be red eemed for cash upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last 20 trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the numb er of DSUs held by the d irector. As of December 31, 2018 , the total number of DSUs held by participating direc tors was 528,483 ( 2017 - 452,981 ). B. Phantom stock option Cameco makes annual grants of bonuses to eligible non-North American employees in the form of phantom stock options. Employees receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the TSX for the common shares of Cam eco on the trading day prior to the date on which the option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date granted . As of December 31, 2018 , the number of options held by participating employees was 353,580 ( 2017 - 391,714 ) with exercise prices ranging from $ 11.32 to $ 39.53 per share ( 2017 - $ 14.70 . to $ 39.53 ) and a weighted average exercise price of $ 17.74 ( 2017 - $ 22.13 ). Cameco has recognized the following expenses (recoveries) under its cash-settled plans : 2018 2017 Deferred share unit plan $ 2,922 $ (42) Phantom stock option plan 675 176 Total $ 3,597 $ 134 At December 31, 2018 , a liability of $ 9 ,352 ,000 ( 2017 - $ 5 ,771 ,000 ) was included in the consolidated statements of financial position to recognize accrued but unpaid expenses for cash-settled plans. Fair value measurement of cash-settled plans The fair value of the phantom stock option plan was measured based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values of the phantom stock option plan at the grant and reporting dates were as follows: Grant date Reporting date March 1, 2018 December 31, 2018 Number of units 101,895 353,580 Average strike price $11.32 $17.74 Expected dividend $0.08 $0.08 Expected volatility 35% 37% Risk-free interest rate 1.9% 1.9% Expected life of option 4.5 years 3.7 years Expected forfeitures 7% 8% Weighted average measurement date fair values $3.68 $4.21"

Financial instruments and related risk management Cameco is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of risks from its use of financial instruments. Management and the board of directors, both separately and together, discuss the principal risks of our businesses. The board sets policies for the implementation of systems to manage, monitor and mitigate identifiable risks. Camecos risk management objective in relation to these instruments is to protect and minimize volatility in cash flow. The types of risks Cameco is exposed to, the source of risk exposure and how each is managed is outlined below. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will aff ect the Companys earnings or the fair value of its financial instruments. Cameco engages in various business activities which expose the Company to market risk. As part of its overall risk management strategy, Cameco uses derivatives to manage some of its exposures to market risk that result from these activities. Derivative instruments may include financial and physical forward contracts. Such contracts may be used to establish a fixed price for a commodity, an interest-bearing obligation or a cash flow d enominated in a foreign currency. Market risks are monitored regularly against defined risk limits and tolerances. Camecos actual exposure to these market risks is constantly changing as the Companys portfolios of foreign currency , interest rate and comm odity contracts change . The types of market risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed are as follows: A. Commodity price risk As a significant producer and supplier of uranium and nuclear fuel processing services, Cameco bears significant exposure to changes in prices for these products. A substantial change in prices will affect the Companys net earnings and operating cash flows. Prices for Camecos products are volatile and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Compan ys control, such as supply and demand fundamentals and geopolitical events. Camecos sales contracting strategy focuses on reducing the volatility in future earnings and cash flow, while providing both protection against decreases in market price and rete ntion of exposure to future market price increases. To mitigate the risks associated with the fluctuations in the market price for uranium products, Cameco seeks to maintain a portfolio of uranium product sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates an d pricing mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from pricing volatility. Cameco is exposed to commodity price risk through its use of a uranium contract derivative. As of the reporting date, a 30 % decrease in the price of uranium based on the Nume rco forward uranium price curve, would result in a loss on this derivative of $ 3,103,000 ($ 2,404,000 (US)). A 30% increase would have an equal but opposite impact. B. Foreign exchange risk The relationship between the Canadian and US dollar affects finan cial results of the uranium business as well as the fuel services business. Sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services are routinely denominated in US dollars while production costs are largely denominated in Canadian dollars. Cam eco attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency, Cameco enters into forward sales and option contracts to establish a p rice for future delivery of the foreign currency. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Cameco also has a natural hedge against US currency fluctuatio ns because a portion of its annual cash outlays, including purchases of uranium and conversion services, is denominated in US dollars. Cameco holds a number of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to foreign excha nge risk. Cameco measures its exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial instruments as the change in carrying values that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined its pre-tax exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on financial instruments to be as follows based on a 5 % weakening of the Canadian dollar: Carrying value Currency (Cdn) Gain (loss) Cash and cash equivalents USD $ 105,463 $ 5,273 Accounts receivable USD 358,904 17,945 Long-term receivables, investments and other USD 124,533 6,227 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities USD (45,474) (2,274) Net foreign currency derivatives USD (52,665) (48,923) A 5% strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the currencies above at December 31, 2018 would have had an equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, assuming all other variables remained constant. C. Interest rate risk The Company has a strategy of minimizing its expo sure to interest rate risk by maintaining target levels of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The proportions of outstanding debt carrying fixed and variable interest rates are reviewed by senior management to ensure that these levels are within approved pol icy limits. At December 31, 2018 , the proportion of Camecos outstanding debt that carries fixed interest rates is 67 % ( 2017 - 80 %). Cameco is exposed to interest rate risk through its interest rate swap contracts whereby fixed rate payments on a notional amount of $ 35 0,000,000 of the Series D senior unsecured debentures and $ 150,000,000 of the Series E senior unsecured debentures were swapped for variable rate payments. The Series D swaps terminate on September 2, 2019. Under the terms of the swap s, Cameco makes interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 3 .6 % and receives fixed interest payments of 5.67 %. The Series E swaps terminate on November 14, 2022. Under the terms of the swaps, Cameco make s interest payments based on the three-month Canada Dealer Offered Rate plus an average margin of 1.2 % and receives fixed interest payments of 3.75 %. At December 31, 2018 , the fair value of Cam ecos interest rate swap net asset was $ 856,000 ( 2017 - n et liability of $ 150 ,000 ). Cameco is also exposed to interest rate risk on its loan facility with Inkai due to the varia ble nature of the interest rate contained in the terms therein (note 31 ) . Cameco measures its exposure to interest rate risk as the change in cash flows that would occur as a result of reasonably possible changes in interest rates, holding all other variables constant. As of the reporting date, the Company has determined the impact on earnings of a 1 % increase in interest rate on variable rate financial instruments to be as follows: Gain (loss) Interest rate contracts $ (4,173) Advances receivable from JV Inkai 1,179 Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is associated with the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations to Cameco, including both payment and performance. The maximum exposure to credit risk, as represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets, at December 31 was: 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 711,528 $ 591,620 Short-term investments 391,025 - Accounts receivable [note 6] 398,639 393,213 Advances receivable from JV Inkai [note 31] 124,533 58,820 Derivative assets [note 10] 3,881 40,804 Cash and cash equivalents Cameco held cash and cash equivalents of $ 712 ,000,000 at December 31, 2018 ( 2017 - $ 592 ,000,000 ). Cameco mitigates its credit risk by ensuring that balances are held with counterparties with high credit ratings. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties on a monthly basis and has controls in place to ensure prescribed exposure limits with each counterparty are adhered to. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credi t risk on cash and cash equivalents by applying historic global default rates to outstanding cash balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this assessment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Short-term investments Cameco held short-term inv estments of $ 391 ,000,000 at December 31, 2018 ( 2017 - $ nil ). The Company mitigates its credit risk by requiring that the issuer/g uarantor of the investment have a minimum short - term credit rating and/or a lon g-term debt rating at the time of purchase, according to the investment credit ratings as iss ued by DBRS or S&amp;P, or the equivalent o f the DBRS or S&amp;P rating at another reputable rating agency. In addition to the credit-rating requirement, Cameco also mitigates risk by prescribing l imits by counterparty and types of investment products. Cameco has assessed its counterparty credit risk related to short-term investments by applying historic default rates to outstanding investment balances based on S&amp;P rating. The conclusion of this ass essment is that the loss allowance is insignificant. Accounts receivable Camecos sales of uranium product, conversion and fuel manufacturing services expose the Company to the risk of non-payment. Cameco manages the risk of non-payment by monitoring the c redit-worthiness of its customers and seeking pre-payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an unacceptable level of credit risk. A summary of the Companys exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows: Carrying value Investment grade credit rating $ 327,682 Non-investment grade credit rating 65,183 Total gross carrying amount $ 392,865 Loss allowance - Net $ 392,865 At December 31, 2018 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and no amounts were held as collateral. Historically, Cameco has experienced minimal customer defaults and, as a result, considers the credit quality of its accounts receivable to be high. Cameco uses customer credit rating data, historic default rates and aged receivable analysis to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from corporate customers, which comprise a small number of large balances. Since the Company has no t experienced customer defaults in the past, applying historic default rates in calculating ECLs, as well as considering forward-looking information, resulted in an insignificant allowance for losses. The following table provides information about Cameco s aged trade receivables as at December 31, 2018 : Corporate Other customers customers Total Current (not past due) $ 389,012 $ 1,269 390,281 1-30 days past due 273 1,833 2,106 More than 30 days past due 96 382 478 Total $ 389,381 $ 3,484 392,865 Cameco had programs for sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable to financial institutions. Through these programs, the Company surrendered the control, risks and benefits associated with the accounts receivable sold. The amount of receivables sold was recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances were removed from the consolidated statement of financial position at the time of sale . These programs were terminated in 2018 and as such, the total amount of receivables sold under these programs and derecognized in accordance with IFRS 9 during 2018 was nil ( 2017 - $ 120,470,000 ($ 92,805,000 (USD))). Advances receivable from JV Inka i Impairment on Camecos unsecured shareholder loan to JV Inkai (note 31 ) was measured by applying the general approach of IFRS 9. In doing so, Cameco determined that the credit risk on the loan had not increased significantly since initial recognition based on a low risk of default and the borrowers strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. It was also concluded that adverse changes in economic and business conditions may, but will not necessarily, reduce the abili ty of the borrower to fulfill its contractual cash flow obligations. As a result, the loan was classified as stage one and the 12-month expected credit losses were analyzed. The Company concluded that the likelihood of a default event occurring in the next 12 months was very low and no allowance for ECLs was recorded. Liquidity risk Financial liquidity represents Camecos ability to fund future operating activities and investments. Cameco ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to cover the likely short-term and long-term cash requirements.

This cash is being used as collateral for an interest rate reduction on the letter of credit facilities. The collateral account has a term of five years effective July 1, 2018. Cameco retains full access to this cash . The investments in equity securities represent investments that Cameco intends to hold for the long-term for strategic purposes. As permitted by IFRS 9, these investments have been desi gnated at the date of initial application as measured at FVOCI. The accumulated fair value reserve related to these investments will never be reclassified to profit or loss. Cameco has not irrevocably designated a financial asset that would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost at FVOCI or FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of Camecos financial instrument s, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy: As at December 31, 2018 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 2,201 $ - $ 2,201 $ 2,201 Interest rate contracts 1,680 - 1,680 1,680 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 28,916 28,916 - 28,916 Current portion of long-term debt [note 13] (499,599) - (511,210) (511,210) Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (54,866) - (54,866) (54,866) Interest rate contracts (823) - (823) (823) Uranium contracts (5,698) - (5,698) (5,698) Long-term debt [note 13] (996,072) - (1,111,782) (1,111,782) Net $ (1,524,261) $ 28,916 $ (1,680,498) $ (1,651,582) As at December 31, 2017 Fair value Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Total Derivative assets [note 10] Foreign currency contracts $ 39,984 $ - $ 39,984 $ 39,984 Interest rate contracts 820 - 820 820 Investments in equity securities [note 10] 21,417 21,417 - 21,417 Derivative liabilities [note 14] Foreign currency contracts (5,624) - (5,624) (5,624) Interest rate contracts (970) - (970) (970) Uranium contracts (16,820) - (16,820) (16,820) Long-term debt [note 13] (1,494,471) - (1,652,230) (1,652,230) Net $ (1,455,664) $ 21,417 $ (1,634,840) $ (1,613,423) The preceding tables exclude fair value information for financial instruments whose carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying value of Camecos cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates its fair value as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period. Cameco does not have any financial instruments that ar e classified as level 3 as of the reporting date. B. Financial instruments measured at fair value Cameco measures its derivative financial instruments, material investments in equity securities, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt at fai r value. Investments in publicly held equity securities are classified as a recurring level 1 fair value measurement while derivative financial instruments and long-term debt are classified as a recurring level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity securities is determined using quoted share prices observed in the principal market for the securities as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos current portion of long-term debt is determined using a quoted market yield of 1.7 % as of the reporting date. The fair value of Camecos long-term debt is determined using quoted market yields as of the reporting date, which ranged from 1.9 % to 2.2 % ( 2017 - 1.6 % to 2.3 %). Foreign currency derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps. The fair value of foreign currency options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is measured using a market approach, based on the d ifference between contracted foreign exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates as of the reporting date. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed interest payments to be received and floating interest payments to be made to the counterparty based on Canada Dealer Offer Rate forward in terest rate curves. Uranium contract derivatives consist of written options and price swaps. The fair value of uranium options is measured based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of uranium price swaps is determined by discounting e xpected future cash flows from the contracts. The future cash flows are determined by measuring the difference between fixed purchases or sales under contracted prices, and floating purchases or sales based on Numerco forward uranium price curves. Where ap plicable, the fair value of the derivatives reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Company and counterparty. These adjustments are based on credit ratings and yield curves observed in active markets at the reporting date.

Pension and other post-retirement benefits Cameco maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension benefits to substantially all of its employees. All regular and temporary employees participate in a registered defined contribution plan. This plan is registered under the Pension Benefits Standard Act, 1985. In addition, all Canadian-based executives participate in a non-registered supplemental execu tive pension plan which is a defined benefit plan. Under the supplemental executive pension plan (SEPP) , Cameco provides a lump sum benefit equal to the present value of a lifetime pension benefit based on the executives length of service and final average earnings. The plan provides for unreduced benefits to be paid at the normal retirement age of 65, however unreduced ben efits could be paid if the executive was at least 60 years of age and had 20 years of service at retirement. This program provides for a benefit determined by a formula based on earnings and service, reduced by the benefits payable under the registered bas e plan. Security is provided for the SEPP benefits through a letter of credit held by the plans trustee. The face amount of the letter of credit is determined each year based on the wind-up liabilities of the supplemental plan, less any plan assets curren tly held with the trustee. A valuation is required annually to determine the letter of credit amount. Benefits will continue to be paid from plan assets until the fund is exhausted, at which time Cameco will begin paying benefits from corporate assets. Cam eco also maintains non-pension post-retirement plans (other benefit plans) which are defined benefit plans that cover such benefits as group life insurance and supplemental health and dental coverage to elig ible employees and their depende nts. The costs related to these plans are charged to earnings in the period during which the employment services are rendered. These plans are funded by Cameco as benefit claims are made. The board of directors of Cameco has final responsibility and accountability for th e Cameco retirement programs. The board is ultimately responsible for managing the programs to comply with applicable legislation, providing oversight over the general functions and setting certain policies. Cameco expects to pay $ 1,044 ,000 in contribution s and letter of credit fees to i ts defined benefit plans in 2019 . The post-retirement plans expose Cameco to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The other benefit plans expo se Cameco to risks of higher supplemental health and dental utilization than expected. However, the other benefit plans have limits on Camecos annual benefits payable. The effective da te of the most recent valuation for funding purposes on the registered defined benefit pension plans is January 1, 2018 . The next planned effective date f or valuations is January 1, 2021 . Cameco has more than one defined benefit plan and has generally provided aggregated disclosures in respect of these plans, on the basis tha t these plans are not exposed to materially different risks.

A 1% change at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following: Pension benefit plans Other benefit plans Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate $ (6,548) $ 8,475 $ (2,784) $ 3,503 Rate of compensation increase 2,481 (2,281) n/a n/a A 1% change in any of the other assumptions would not have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation. The methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses are the same as the methods and assumptions used in determining the financial position of Cameco s plans as at December 31, 2018 . The sensitivity analyses are determined by varying the sensitivity assumption and leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses do not recognize any interdependence in the assumptions. The methods and assumptions used in determining the above sensitivity are consistent with t he methods and assumptions used in the previous year. In addition, an increase of one year in the expected lifetime of plan participants in the pension benefit plans would increase the defined benefit obligation by $ 1,245 ,000 . To measure the longevity risk for these plans, the mortality rates were reduced such that the average life expectancy for all members increased by one year. The reduced mortality rates were subsequently used to re-measure the defined benefit obligation of the entire plan."

Reclamation provision Cameco's estimates of future decommissioning obligations are based on reclamation standards that satisfy regulatory requirements. Elements of uncertainty in estimating these amounts include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and amounts to be recovered from other parties. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future decommissioning and reclamation costs for its existing operating assets to be $ 1,157,208,000 ( 2017 - $ 1,051,746 ,000 ) . The expected timing of these outflows is based on life-of-mine plans with the majority of expenditu res expected to occur after 2023 . These estimates are reviewed by Cameco technical personnel as required by regulatory agencies or more frequently as circu mstances warrant. In connection with future decommissioning and reclamation costs, Cameco has provided financial assurances of $ 1,050,546,000 ( 2017 - $ 1,011,613 ,000 ) in the form of letters of credit to satisfy current regulatory requirements. The reclam ation provision relates to the following segments: 2018 2017 Uranium $ 828,781 $ 669,835 Fuel services 225,111 235,565 Total $ 1,053,892 $ 905,400 B. Waste disposal The fuel services segment consists of the Blind River refinery, Port Hope conversion facility and Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc. . The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium contaminated waste. These include contaminated combustible material (paper, rags, gloves, etc.) and contaminated non-combustible material (metal parts, soil from excavations, building and roofing materials, spent uranium concentrate drums, etc.). These materials can in some instanc es be recycled or reprocessed. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Cameco estimates total undiscounted future costs related to existing waste disposal to be $ 9,617,000 ( 2017 - $ 8,239, 000 ). The majority of these expenditures are expecte d to occur within the next six years."

Significant accounting policies A. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Companys board of directors on February 7, 2019 . B. Basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Company s functional currency. All financial information is presented in Canadian dollars , unless otherwise noted. A mounts presented in tabular format have been rounded to the nearest thousand except per share amounts and where otherwise noted. The consolidated f inancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date: Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity investments Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements FVTPL Net defined benefit liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods a ffected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5 . This summary of significant accounting policies is a desc ription of the accounting methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained herein. These accounting policies have been app lied consistently to all entities within the consolidated group. C. Consolidation principles i. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The Company measures goo dwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired an d liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in earnings. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Companys previ ously held equity interest in the acquiree is also considered in computing goodwill. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based compensation awards that are replaced mandatorily in a business combination. The Company elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure any non-controlling interest at fair val ue, or at their proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for those costs related to the issue of debt or equity instrume nts. ii. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transfer red to the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. iii. Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subse quently reports profits, Cameco resumes recognizing its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognized. iv. Joint arrangements A joint arrangement can take the form of a joint operation or joint vent ure. All joint arrangements involve a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabil ities, relating to the arrangement. A joint operation may or may not be structured through a separate vehicle. These arrangements involve joint control of one or more of the assets acquired or contributed for the purpose of the joint operation. The consoli dated financial statements of the Company include its share of the assets in such joint operations, together with its share of the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from those operations. All such amounts are measured in accor dance with the terms of each arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is always structured through a separate vehicl e. It operates in the same way as other entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own revenue and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, wher eby the Companys proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are recognized on a single line in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of earnings. The shar e of joint ventures results is recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date that joint control commences until the date at which it ceases. v. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions , and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investm ent to the extent of the Companys interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. D. Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of Camecos subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statem ents are presented in Canadian dollars, which is Camecos functional and presentation currency. i. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of the Company and its entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that ar e measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are reflected in earnings with the exception of forei gn exchange gains or losses on provisions for decommissioning and reclamation activities that are in a foreign currency, which are capitalized in property, plant and equipment. ii. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, inc luding goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting dates. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at exchange rates at the date s of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in whole , the relevant amount in the foreign currency translation account is transferred to earnings as part of the g ain or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the foreign currency translation account. E. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, which have a term to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase and are classified as at amortized cost . F. Short-term investment s Short-term investments are comprised of money market instruments with terms to maturity between three and 12 months and are classified as at amortized cost. G. Inventories Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates, and refined and converted products are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value. H. Property, plant and equipment i. Buildings, plant and equipment and other Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, including the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. When components of an item of property, plant and e quipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and depreciated separately. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds fr om disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized in earnings. ii. Mineral properties and mine development costs The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the comme rcial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other expenditures relating to the project area are deferred as part of assets under construction and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment with the intention that these will be depreciated by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No depreciation is charged against the property until the product ion stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are de termined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site. A range of factors is considered when determining whether the production stage has been reached, which includes, but is not limited to, the demonstrati on of sustainable production at or near the level intended (such as the demonstration of continuous throughput levels at or above a target percentage of the design capacity). iii. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset less its residual value. Assets which are unrelated to production are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows: Land Not depreciated Buildings 15 - 25 years Plant and equipment 3 - 15 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Other 3 - 5 years Mining properties and certain mining and conversion assets for which the economic benefits from the asset are consumed in a pattern which is linked to the production level are depreciated according to the unit-of-production method. For conversion assets, the amount of depreciation is measured by the portion of the facilities' total estimated lifetime production that is produ ced in that period. For mining assets and properties, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion of the mines' proven and probable mineral reserves recovered during the period. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. iv. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs on funds directly attributable to finance the acquisition, production or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized until such time as sub stantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset ente rs the production stage or development ceases. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, interest is capitalized based on the weighted average interest rate applicable to the general borrowings outstanding during the period of construction. v. Repairs and maintenance The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Company. The carrying amount o f the replaced component is derecognized. Costs of routine maintenance and repair are charged to products and services sold. I. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost, measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired . At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs that is expected to receive the ec onomic benefits of the business combination . Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group of assets are initially recognized at cost and measured subsequently a t cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The cost of a group of intangible assets acquired in a transaction, including those acquired in a business combination that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values. Intangible assets that have finite us eful lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted if appropriate. J. Leased assets Leases which result in the Company receiving substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial re cognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between finance cost and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance cost is allocated to each period of the lease term to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Lease agreements that do not meet the recognition criteria of a finance lease are classified and recognized as operatin g leases and are not recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. K. Finance income and finance costs Finance income co mprises interest income on f unds invested . Interest income and interest expense are recognized in earnings as they accrue , using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest and fees on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and costs incurred on redemption of debentures . Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed in the period incurred. L. Research and development costs Expenditures on research are charged against earnings when incurred. Development costs are recognized as assets when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. M. Impairment i. Non-derivativ e financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs , except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allo wances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possib le within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reaso nable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and includi ng forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impair ed . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a b reach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market f or a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying a mount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof . ii. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed a t each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped togeth er into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted t o their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the C GU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may h ave reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have be en determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. N. Exploration and evaluatio n expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures are those expenditures incurred by the Company in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a miner al resource are demonstrable. These expenditures include researching and analyzing existing exploration data, conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, and compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasib ility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable. When an area is det ermined to be technically feasible and commercially viable, the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area are first tested for impairment and then transferred to property, plant and equipment. Exploration and evaluation costs that have be en acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are capitalized under the scope of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources , and are reported as part of property, plant and equipment. O. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by disc ounting the risk-adjusted expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost . i. Environmental restoration The mining , extraction and processing activities of the Company normally give rise to obligations for site closure and environmental restoration. Closure and restoration can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, a s well as site and land restoration. The Company provides for the closure, reclamation and decommissioning of its operating sites in the financial period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs using informati on available at the reporting date. Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate cl osure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of fa ctors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value u sing a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration act ivities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized i n finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively. ii. Waste disposal The refining, conversion and manufacturing processes generate certain uranium-contaminated waste. The Company has established strict procedures to ensure this waste is d isposed of safely. A provision for waste disposal costs in respect of these materials is recognized when they are generated. Costs associated with the disposal, the timing of cash flows and discount rates are estimated both at initial recognition and subse quent measurement. P. Employee future benefits i. Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee s ervice in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated ann ually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have ter ms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods dur ing which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. ii. Other post-retirement benefit plans The Company provides certain post-ret irement health care benefits to its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrue d over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annuall y by independent qualified actuaries. iii. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected t o be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be measured reliably. iv. Termination benefits Term ination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts an entitys offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. Cameco recognizes termination benefits as an expense at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, they are discounted to their present value. v. Share-based compensation For equity-settled plans, the grant date fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee benefit expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the peri od that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimatel y recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For cash-settled plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re - measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recogniz ed as employee benefit expense in earnings. Camecos contributions under the employee share ownership plan are expensed during the year of contribution. Shares purchased with Company contributions and with dividends paid on such shares become unrestricted on January 1 of the second plan year following the date on which such shares were purchased. Q. Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Revenue is measured based on t he consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Camecos sales arrangements wi th its customers are pursuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery is considered a separate perf ormance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to convers ion facilities (Converters) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Co nverters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to t he customers account at the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the cus tomers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enriche r to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a cus tomers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another loca tion based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and assoc iated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portio n of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognize s revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facili ties on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered . R. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of ano ther . Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to it s acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price . i. Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless t he Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Inter est income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely pa yments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in p rofit or loss. Other net gains and losses are re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trad ing, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in pr ofit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial ass ets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be meas ured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a tr ansaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the fina ncial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets woul d not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified ter ms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss . iIi. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. D erivative fi nancial instruments are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position, with any directly attributable transact io n costs recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss . The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in t he fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company does not have any instruments that have been designated as hedge transactions at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . S. Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current ta x is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilit ies are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the am ounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differenc es when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they rel ate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposur e will materialize. T. Share capital Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of any tax effects. U. Earnings per share The Company presen ts basic and diluted earnings per share data for its common shares. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings pe r share is determined by adjusting the net earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options which are dilutive to earnings per share are exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of s hares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. V. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relat e to transactions with any of the Companys other segments. To be classified as a segment, discrete financial information must be available and operating results must be regularly reviewed by the Companys executive team . Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill."

Investments in equity-accounted investees Camecos investments in equity-accounted investees include investments in associates . Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity, but can also arise where the Company holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method involves the recording of t he initial investment at cost and the subsequent adjusting of the carrying value of the investment for Camecos proportionate share of the earnings or loss and any other changes in the associates net assets, such as dividends. The cost of the investment i ncludes transaction costs. Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate with those of the Company before applying the equity method. When the Companys share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the car rying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

No depreciation is charged against the property until the product ion stage commences. After a mine property has been brought into the production stage , costs of any additional work on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be deferred and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. The production stage is reached when a mine property is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The criteria used to assess the start date of the production stage are de termined based on the nature of each mine construction project, including the complexity of a mine site.

Non-derivativ e financial assets Cameco recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI, and contract assets. It measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs , except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities, loans advanced and bank balances for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For these, loss allo wances are measured equal to 12-month ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument while 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possib le within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reaso nable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Companys historical experience and informed credit assessment and includi ng forward-looking information. The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by Cameco to actions such as realizing security (if any is held). The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when it is at least an A (low) DBRS or A- S&amp;P rating. Financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether they are credit-impair ed . A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. E vidence can include significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer , a b reach of contract, restructuring of an amount due to the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization , or the disappearance of an active market f or a security . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to earnings and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying a mount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof ."

Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of Camecos non-financial assets are reviewed a t each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped togeth er into CGUs which are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted t o their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset or CGU in an arms-length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. For exploration properties, fair value is based on the implied fair value of the resources in place using comparable market transaction metrics. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the C GU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may h ave reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have be en determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in earnings. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed."

Exploration and evaluation expenditures are charged against earnings as incurred, except when there is a high degree of confidence in the viability of the project and it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future development and exploitation. The technical feasib ility and commercial viability of extracting a resource is considered to be determinable based on several factors, including the existence of proven and probable reserves and the demonstration that future economic benefits are probable.

Costs included in the provision comprise all closure and restoration activity expected to occur gradually over the life of the operation and at the time of closure. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate cl osure and restoration activities, such as waste material handling conducted as a normal part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. The timing of the actual closure and restoration expenditure is dependent upon a number of fa ctors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. Closure and restoration provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value u sing a current pre-tax risk-free rate. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in deriving the expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. At the time a provision is initially recognized, to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the reclamation, decommissioning and restoration expenditure will flow to the Company, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset. The capitalized cost of closure and restoration act ivities is recognized in property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The value of the provision is gradually increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is an expense recognized i n finance costs. Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. The provision is reviewed at each reporting date for changes to obligations, legislation or discount rates that effect change in cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision resulting from changes in estimated cash flows or discount rates, and the adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively."

Revenue recognition Cameco su pplies uranium concentrates, uranium conversion services , fabrication services and other services . Revenue is measured based on t he consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control, as described below, over a good or service to a customer. Customers do not have the right to return products. Camecos sales arrangements wi th its customers are pursuant to enforceable contract s that indicate the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms, where payment is usually due in 30 days . Each delivery is considered a separate perf ormance obligation under the contract. Uranium supply In a uranium supply arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide uranium concentrates to its cus tomers. Cameco-owned uranium may be physically delivered to either the customer or to convers ion facilities (Converters) . For deliveries to customers, terms in the sales contract specify the location of delivery. Revenue is recognized when the uranium has been delivered and accepted by the customer at that location. When uranium is delivered to Co nverters, the Converter will credit Camecos account for the volume of accepted uraniu m. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract with its customer, Cameco instructs the Converter to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of uranium to t he customers account at the Conver ters facility. At this point, control has been transferred and C ameco recognizes revenue for the uranium supply. Toll conversion services In a toll conversion arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to convert customer-owned uranium to a chemical state suitable for enrichment. Based on delivery terms in a sales contract with its customer, Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to enrichment facilities (Enrichers) where it instructs the Enricher to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or the cus tomers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility . At this point, the customer obtains control and C ameco recognizes revenue for the toll conversion services. Conversion supply A conversion supply arrangement is a combination of uranium supply and toll conversion services. Cameco is contractually obligated to provide converte d uranium to its customer s. Based on delivery terms in the sales contract , Cameco either (i) physically delivers converted uranium to the Enricher where it instructs the Enriche r to transfer title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to the customers account at the Enrichers facility, or (ii) transfers title of a contractually specified quantity of converted uranium to either an Enrichers account or a cus tomers account at Camecos Port Hope conversion facility. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for both the uranium supplied and the conversion service provided . Fabrication services In a fabrication services arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to provide fuel bundles or reactor components to its customers. In a contract for fuel bundles, the bundles are inspected and accepted by the customer at Camecos Port Hope fabrication facility or another loca tion based on delivery terms in the sales contract. At this point, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognizes revenue for the fabrication services. In some contracts for reactor components, the components are made to a customers specification and if a contract is terminated by the customer, Cameco is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin. Since the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are being manufactured, revenue and assoc iated costs are recognized over time, before the goods are delivered to the customers premises. Revenue is recognized on the basis of units produced as the contracts reflect a per unit basis. Revenue from these contracts represents an insignificant portio n of Camecos total revenue. In other contracts where the reactor components are not made to a specific customers specification, when the components are delivered to the location specified in the contract, the customer obtains control and Cameco recognize s revenue for the services. Other services Uranium concentrates and converted uranium are regulated products and can only be stored at regulated facilities. In a storage arrangement, Cameco is contractually obligated to store uranium products at its facili ties on behalf of the customer. Cameco invoices the customer in accordance with the contract terms and recognizes revenue on a monthly basis. Cameco also provides customers with transportation of its uranium products. In the contractual arrangements where Cameco is acting as the principal, revenue is recognized as the product is delivered ."

Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss . The purpose of hedging transactions is to modify the Companys exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in t he fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging item. When hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a foreign currency risk hedge related to a net investment in a foreign operation.

Income tax Income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in earnings except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current ta x is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilit ies are measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the am ounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differenc es when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they rel ate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. The Companys exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is probable that this exposur e will materialize."

Segmented information As a result of a change to the way its global marketing activities are organized, during 2018, Cameco discontinued the reporting of NUKEM as a reportable segment. The consolidation of Canadian and international marketing activities in Saskatoon has resulted in NUKEMs activities no longer meeting the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Its results are now included in the other column and comparative information has been adjusted. Cameco now has two reportabl e segments: uranium and fuel services. Cameco's reportable segments are strategic business units with different products, processes and marketing strategies . The uranium segment involves the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase and sale of uranium co ncentrate. The fuel services segment involves the refining, conversion and fabrication of uranium concentrate and the purchase and sale of conversion services.

Pension obligations The Company accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee s ervice in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan other than a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated ann ually, by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method prorated on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have ter ms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and reports them in retained earnings. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized immediately in earnings. For defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense in earnings in the periods dur ing which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available."

The realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions during the periods in which the Companys deferred t ax assets are available.

Reassessments Canada In 2008, as part of the ongoing annual audits of Cameco's Canadian tax returns, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) disputed the transfer pricing structure and methodology used by Cameco and its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Cameco Europe Ltd., in respect of sale and purchase agreements for uranium products. From December 2008 to date, CRA issued notices of reassessment for the taxation years 2003 through 2012, which in aggregate have increased Cameco's income for Canadian tax purpos es by approximately $ 4,900,000,000 . CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2011 in the amount of $ 371,000,000 . It is uncertain whether CRA will reassess Cameco's tax returns for subsequent year s on a similar basis and if these will require Cameco to make future remittances or provide security on receipt of the reassessments . On September 26, the Tax Court of Canada (Tax Court) ruled in our favour in our case with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 tax years . The Tax Court ruled that our marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries and the related transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany uranium purchase and sale agreements were in full compliance with Canadian laws for the three tax years in question. While the dec ision applies only to the three tax years in question , we believe there is nothing in the decision that would warrant a materially different outcome for subsequent tax years. Given the ruling in our favor, and the endorsement by the Tax Court of our transfer pricing methodology, we have reversed the cumulative tax provision related to this matter for the years 2003 through the current period in the amount of $ 61,000,000 . We exp ect to recover any amounts remitted or secured as a result of the reassessments . On October 25, 2018, CRA filed a notice of appeal with the Federal Court of Appeal. We anticipate that it will take about two years from the start of the appeal process to rec eive a decision from the Federal Court of Appeal . We expect the Tax Courts decision to be upheld on appeal. We expect any further actions regarding the tax years 2007 through 2012 will be suspended until the three years covered in th e decision are finally resolved . Despite the fact that we believe there is no basis to do so, and it is not our view of the likely outcome, CRA may continue to reassess us using the methodology it used to reassess the 2003 through 2012 tax years . In that scenario, and including the $ 4,900,000,000 already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $ 8,700,000,000 for the years 2003 through 2018, which would increase Camecos income for Canadian tax purposes and result in a related tax exp ense of approximately $ 2,600,000,000 . In addition to penalties already imposed, CRA may continue to apply penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2011. In that case, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties would be between $ 1,950,000,0 00 and $ 2,150,000,000 . In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to Cameco. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise securing 50 % of the cash taxes and transfer pric ing penalties (between $ 970,000,000 and $ 1,070,000,000 ), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to Cameco . Under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be remitted each year will depend o n the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions. CRA disallowed the use of any loss carry-backs to be applied to any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to CRA, including cash taxes, interest and penalties totalling $ 303,222,000 already paid as at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - $ 303,222,000 ) (note 10 ). In addition to the cash remi tted, we have provided $ 478,000,000 in letters of credit to secure 50 % of the cash taxes and related interest. Management believes that the ultimate resolution will not be material to Cameco's financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the y ear(s) of resolution. Resolution of this matter as stipulated by CRA would be material to Camecos financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the year(s) of resolution and other unfavourable outcomes for the years 2003 to date could be mater ial to Cameco's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolutio n. Further to Cameco's decision to contest CRA's reassessments, Cameco is pursuing its appeal rights under Canadian federal and provincial tax rules . G. Income tax losses At December 31, 2018 , income tax losses carried forward of $2,809 ,926 ,000 ( 2017 - $ 2,609 ,070 ,000 ) are available to reduce taxable income.

Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estima tes are revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is discussed below. Furthe r details of the nature of these judgments, estimates and assumptions may be found in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. A. Recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plan t and equipment, and intangible assets when there is an indication of possible impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use or with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually. If it is determined that carrying values of assets or goodwill cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are charged against current earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding market conditions, costs of production, sustaining capital requirements and min eral reserves. Other assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, future cash flows and profit margins. A material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets. B. Cash generati ng units In performing impairment assessments of long-lived assets, assets that cannot be assessed individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other a ssets or groups of assets. Management is required to exercise judgment in identifying these CGUs. C. Provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until near the e nd of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either the estimated costs , timing of the cash flows or mineral reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged to earnings. D. I ncome taxes Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is, therefore, required to estimate its income taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated fin ancial statements. In calculating income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, changes in tax law and managements expectations of future operating results. Cameco estimates defe rred income taxes based on temporary differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these temporary differences is recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. The determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is de pendent on assumptions and judg ments regarding future market conditions, production rates and intercompany sales . If these judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earn ings may be materially impacted. E. Mineral reserves Depreciation on property, plant and equip ment is primarily calculated using the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated mineral reserves. Estimates o f life-of-mine and amounts of mineral reserves are updated annually and are subject to judgment and significant change over time. If actual mineral reserves prove to be significantly different than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amo unts of depreciation charged to earnings. F. Determination of joint control Cameco conducts certain operations through joint ownership interests. Judgment is required in assessing whether Cameco has joint control over the investee, which involves determi ning the relevant activities of the arrangement and whether decisions around relevant activities require unanimous consent. Judgment is also required to determine whether a joint arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or joint operation. Class ifying the arrangement requires us to assess our rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. Specifically, management considers the structure of the joint arrangement and whether it is structured through a separate vehicle and when the arrangement is structured through a separate vehicle, we also consider the rights and obligations arising from the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangements and other facts and circumstances, when relevant. This judgment influences whether we equity account or proportionately consolidate our interest in the arrangement . G. Gain on restructuring The gain recorded on the restructuring of JV Inkai was calculated based on the fair value of the asset being given up. The determination of fair value requires Cameco to make assumptions, estimates and judgments, some of which are inherently subjective ."

Joint operations Cameco conducts a portion of its exploration, development, mining and milling activities through joint operations located around the world. Operations are governed by agreements that provide for joint control of the strategic operating, investing and financing activities among the partners. These agreements were considered in the determination of joint control. Camecos significant Canadian uranium joint operation interests are McArthur River, Key Lake and Cigar Lake. The Canad ian uranium joint operations allocate uranium production to each joint operation participant and the joint operation participant derives revenue directly from the sale of such product. Mining and milling expenses incurred by joint operations are included i n the cost of inventory . As a result of the restructuring of JV Inkai, effective January 1, 2018 Camecos ownership interest was reduced to 40% (previously 60 %) and Cameco began accounting for JV Inkai on an equity basis. In 2017, the participants in the I nkai joint operation purchased uranium from JV Inkai and, in turn, derived revenue directly from the sale of such product to third party customers .

Accounting standards A. Changes in accounting policy On January 1, 2018 , Cameco adopted the following new standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in accordance with the transitional provisions: i. Revenue IFRS 15 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. Cameco adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method without practical expedients which does not require comparat ive financial statements to be restated. As the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our existing revenue recognition practices, there was no cumulative effect on net earnings at January 1, 2018 that would have required restatemen t. The new standard did result in additional disclosures. See note 17 . ii. Financial instruments IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets. While it largely retains the e xisting requirements in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities, it eliminates the previous categories for financial assets of held to maturity, loans and receivables and av ailable for sale. Upon adoption, we reclassified our financial instruments as follows: Original classification under IAS 39 New classification under IFRS 9 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Amortized cost Accounts receivable Loans and receivables Amortized cost Derivative assets FVTPL FVTPL Investments in equity securities Available for sale FVOCI Advances receivable from Inkai Loans and receivables Amortized cost Financial liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Other financial liabilities Amortized cost Dividends payable Other financial liabilities Amortized cost Derivative liabilities FVTPL FVTPL Long-term debt Other financial liabilities Amortized cost There was no impact on the measurement of any of these instruments at the date of transition. We did not have any financial assets or liabilities previously designated as measured at FVTPL that are no longer so designated. The new standard also includes a new ECL model for calculating impairment on financial assets. This change did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See note 26 . IFRS 9 also introduces new hedge accounting requirements . Since Cameco does not apply hedge a ccounting, there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements. B. New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards are not yet effective for the year ended December 31, 2018 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Cameco does not intend to early adopt any of the following standards or amendments to existing standards, unless otherwise noted. i. Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFR S 16, Leases (IFRS 16). IFRS 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balanc e sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. Our assessment of the new standard included the review of contracts to identify arrangements that could contain lea ses that qualify for recognition under IFRS 16. This review also considered contracts containing embedded leases of right-of-use assets. Based on our assessment, which is substantially complete, we determined that we do not expect adoption of the standard to have a material impact on the financial statements, however we do expect to have additional disclosures. ii. Income tax In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (IFRIC 23) . IFRIC 23 is effective for periods beginn ing on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the accounting for current and deferred tax liabilities and assets in circumstances in which there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. We do not expect ado ption of the standard to have a material impact on the financial statements."

Determination of fair values A number of the Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The fair value of an asset or liability is generally estimated as the amount that would be received on sale of an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Fair values of assets and liabilities traded in an active market are determined by reference to last quoted prices, in the principal market for the asset or liability. In the absence of an active market for an asset or liability, fair values are determined based on market quotes fo r assets or liabilities with similar characteristics and risk profiles, or through other valuation techniques. Fair values determined using valuation techniques require the use of inputs, which are obtained from external, readily observable market data whe n available. In some circumstances, inputs that are not based on observable data must be used. In these cases, the estimated fair values may be adjusted in order to account for valuation uncertainty, or to reflect the assumptions that market participants w ould use in pricing the asset or liability. All fair value measurements are categorized into one of three hierarchy levels, described below, for disclosure purposes. Each level is based on the transparency of the inputs used to measure the fair values of assets and liabilities: Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the reporting date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2  Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inpu ts that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3  Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair valu e measurement. When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within more than one level of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measuremen t in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period. Cameco does not ha ve any recurring fair value measurements that are categorized as level 3 as of the reporting date. Further information about the techniques and assumptions used to measure fair values is included in the following notes: Note 8 - Property, plant and equ ipment Note 9 - Goodwill and intangible assets Note 24 - Share-based compensation plans Note 26 - Financial instruments and risk management"

Financial assets On initial recognition , financial assets are classified as measured at : amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Companys business model for managing its financial assets and their cash flow characteristics. Classifications are not changed subsequent to initial recognition unless t he Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model. Amortized cost A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . Assets in this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Inter est income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss, as is any gain or loss on derecognition. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely pa yments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding . These assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in p rofit or loss. Other net gains and losses are re cognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) . On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trad ing, Cameco may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in pr ofit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) All financial ass ets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL . This includes all derivative financial asset s. On initial recognition, the C ompany may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be meas ured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Cameco derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a tr ansaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which it neither transfers or retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the fina ncial asset. If the Company enters into a transaction whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets woul d not be derecognized. ii. Financial liabilitie s On initi al recognition, financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL . A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for- trading, is a derivative or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss as is any gain or loss on derecognition. A financial liability is derecognized when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified ter ms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss ."

Revenue Camecos sales contracts with customers contain both fixed and market-related pricing. Fixed-price contracts are typically based on a term-price indicator at the time the contract is accepted and escalated over the term of the contract. Market-related contracts are based on either the spot price or long-term price, and the price is quoted at the time of delivery rather than at the time the contract is accepted. These contracts often include a floor and/or ceiling prices, which are usually escalated over the term of the contract. Escalation is generally based o n a consumer price index. The Companys contracts contain either one of these pricing mechanisms or a combination of the two. There is no variable consideration in the contracts and t herefore no revenue is considered constrained at the time of delivery .

The revenue related to the fuel fabrication services and storage is recognized over time while the revenue related to future conversion deliveries is expected to be recognized between 2020 and 2025 . Cameco recognized $ 5,468,000 ( 2017 - $ 4,392,000 ) as a reduction of revenue during 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods.

The amounts include assumptions about volumes for contracts that have volume flexibility. Camecos total revenue that will be earned will also include revenue from contracts with market-related pricing.
